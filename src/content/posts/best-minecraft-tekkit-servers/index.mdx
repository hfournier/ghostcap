### APOC Gaming

**Server IP: play.apocgaming.org**

It is one of the largest servers and has multi-server [vanilla](https://www.ghostcap.com/best-minecraft-vanilla-servers/) and modded versions of Minecraft accessible to the player. There are a host of servers that range from version 1.5.2 to 1.16.x of Minecraft. Almost all the servers are hosted independently.

The server boasts features like [Towny](https://www.ghostcap.com/best-minecraft-towny-servers/), [Factions](https://www.ghostcap.com/best-minecraft-faction-servers/), Dozens of worlds for players to explore, an active Discord server, mail, chat, and fewer than ten banned items.

However, depending on where you are located, there might not be as many players available, but that’s something you can expect for every other server.

### RedCoreNetwork

**Server IP: tcr.redcorenetwork.net**

The RedCoreNetwork presents Tekkit Classic. The server has been updated to 1.12.2 version, the original Tekkit Classic, in addition to two of the latest mods.

Interestingly this server has been running since 2017, and to date, it is pretty stable, with almost no lag. One of the ways lag is reduced by this server is to pre-generate worlds. However, in our experience, which has mostly been smooth, it does not make much of a difference.

### Aurora Craft

**Server IP: bteam.auroracraft.info**

It is part of the original Aurora Network, which was later removed, and now it is back up. The server has been rebranded, but there are a few improvements that are still required. In addition to Tekkit, the server hosts many other Minecraft mod packs, which is one of the reasons why it continues to grow steadily.

### Dungeontale

**Server IP: beastpvp.eu**

When it comes to Tekkit servers, this is one of the biggest, most diverse ones out there. It is also more than just a server. There is an entire community behind the server, which isn’t limited to Tekkit, but other Minecraft mods. If you are new, then there is also a lot to learn here, which may seem daunting at first, but that’s the way Minecraft is supposed to be.

## What Is Minecraft Tekkit?

Tekkit, for those who may not be familiar with the Minecraft scene, is a mod that introduces a large selection of new elements, machines, and items to the game.

The focus of Tekkit is mainly industrialization which means setting up machines and upgrading them. But there are other features worth mentioning like new weapons, bigger chests, armor, pocket dimensions, and a solar system for you to explore.

Tekkit has 60 additional mods, so, like most players, you can expect to explore the game for a very long time. While some may assume it is a complex endeavor to install each mod separately, there is a way to do it.

You can get the Tekkit mod pack from the Technic Platform. Once the launcher is installed, you can then use it to download Tekkit and other modpacks, after which you play directly via the launcher. The benefit of taking this approach is that you can easily switch from vanilla Minecraft to Tekkit.

However, like everything else with Minecraft, Tekkit is best enjoyed when played with others. So, to do that, you need a server. Below are a couple of the best ones we know of.

## Conclusion

There you have it, folks, the best Tekkit servers out there. Let us know your favorite servers.
