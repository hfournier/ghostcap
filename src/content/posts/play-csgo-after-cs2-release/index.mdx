## What Is The CSGO Demo Viewer?

The CSGO demo viewer is what is used for reviewing old demos. These are like videos of past matches. You can also use this to play old maps, join community servers, although we don't know how long valve will keep this around for.

## What Servers Can You Join?

Unfortunately, as all the Valve servers have been ported to CS2, you won't be able to play matchmaking. However, you will still be able to join community servers. I suggest looking for community who are still running servers on Google or Discord as the in game server browser is flooded with fake servers. Simply follow this video on how to join them via an IP address.
