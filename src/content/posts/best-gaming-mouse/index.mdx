## What To Look For When Picking The Best Gaming Mouse

While the features that make a great gaming mouse can be suggestive, some are worth knowing. When shopping for a perfect gaming mouse the following considerations might help you make a sound decision.

### Type of sensor

A gaming mouse will come with either an optical or a laser sensor. Always look to select that which has a high tracking precision- in this case, the optical sensor. Laser sensors are slower but work best on any surface.

### RGB Lighting and Customization

Most gaming mice like the Razar and Logitech have customizable RGB lights. Consider these factors more of aesthetic-based but they can help illuminate the mouse in dark settings.

### Size of mouse

Wireless mouses come in different sizes and shapes. Generally, a large gaming mouse is best for games with low sensitivity. On the flip side, games with higher FPS (frames per second) may require a slightly smaller mouse.

## Why Do You Need A Gaming Mouse
