Satisfactory is a first-person open-world simulation strategy game that offers players a unique blend of factory building, a dash of exploration and combat, and the thrill of pioneering for Ficsit Incorporated. Developed by Coffee Stain Studios and powered by Unreal Engine 4, Satisfactory was first released in early access in March 2019 and is currently available on both Steam and Epic Games platforms.

As a player, you're tasked with entering conveyor belts, providing short-term solutions, and automating vehicles to ensure the smooth running of your factory. But what happens when you need to save your progress or want to transfer your game data to another PC or [dedicated Satisfactory server](https://www.ghostcap.com/satisfactory-dedicated-server/)? That's where understanding the Satisfactory save game location comes into play.

## Locating Your Satisfactory Save Game Files

Whether you're playing the Steam or Epic Games version, locating your Satisfactory save files is crucial. These files store your game saves, including your factory's current state, your technology progress, and your interaction with the alien lifeforms on the planet.

The default save file location for Satisfactory is hidden within your computer's file system. Here's how to find your Satisfactory save game location:

1.  Open the **'File Explorer'** on your Windows PC.
2.  In the search bar, type `**%localappdata%**` and press Enter.
3.  Navigate to the **'FactoryGame'** folder.
4.  Inside the **'FactoryGame'** folder, go to **'Saved'** -> **'SaveGames'**.
5.  Within the **'SaveGames'** folder, you'll find another folder with a random ID. This folder contains your Satisfactory save files.

The save files are stored with the `.sav` extension. Each file represents a different save state of your game.

## Understanding the Save File Structure

The Satisfactory save files are named in a specific way to provide information about the game state. The naming convention is as follows:

`**SaveName_TimeStamp.sav**`

The `SaveName` is the name you gave your save when you saved your game. The `TimeStamp` is the date and time when the game was saved, formatted as `YYYY.MM.DD-HH.MM.SS`.

## Transferring Your Satisfactory Save Files

If you want to transfer your Satisfactory game saves to another PC, you can do so by copying the `.sav` files from the save game location to an external storage device. Then, on the new PC, paste these files into the same directory path.

Remember, both PCs need to have the same version of the game installed for the save files to work correctly.

## Editing Your Satisfactory Save Files

While Satisfactory doesn't provide an in-game option to edit your save files, several community-developed tools can help you modify your game state. Please note that editing your save files can lead to unexpected game behavior or even corrupt your save. Always make a backup of your save files before using any editor tool.

## Conclusion

Understanding the Satisfactory save game location is essential for managing your game saves, transferring your progress to another PC, or even editing your game state. This guide has provided you with the necessary knowledge to locate, understand, and manipulate your Satisfactory save files.

Remember, Satisfactory is more than just a building game. It's about exploring new technologies, dealing with alien lifeforms, and creating multi-story factories. So, whether you're a new player or a seasoned factory builder, knowing how to manage your save files can save the day.
