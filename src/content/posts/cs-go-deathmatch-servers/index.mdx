What are the best CS GO deathmatch servers?

The answer to this question is not as straightforward as you might think.

Consider these questions:

- What kind of player are you?
- Do you want a server with active players or one that has fewer people but more guns and grenades?
- Are there any specific maps that you're interested in playing on, like de_dust2 or cs_italy?

We've compiled a list of what we think are some of the best CSGO deathmatch servers for all types of gamers.

Read on to see if we find your perfect match!

## 6 Best CS GO Deathmatch Servers

Here are a few of the best CS GO deathmatch servers that we think you should check out.

### 1\. Aim Monster

![GhostCap Gaming GCL cs go competive server](GhostCap-Gaming-GCL-cs-go-competive-server.png)

Aim Monster is an up-and-coming competitive server network for the hardcore CSGO player. Right now they are currently in beta but have some custom plugins to bring an extremely polished warmup experience to gamers.

When the server is empty, they have custom AI bots that act like real plays, they peak, crouch, jump, and flick shot you. It's a real challenge!

They currently only have 1 warmup server but once the config is done with this server, they will be expanding to USA, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

Another perk is they plan to give away real-life rewards such as mech, hardware, etc just for playing on their servers and winning seasons.

- Unique experience with polished plugins
- A safe and friendly atmosphere for less toxic players
- Aim Monster staff are flexible, kind, and always available to help!
- Aim Monster will be free-to-play when it launches so sign up now!

One thing to keep in mind is the server is beta. So their ranking system is not 100% right now, but it also means you can join their Discord and give feedback about your experience to make it better.

Aim Monster is worth a try today!

## What Is A CS GO Deathmatch Server?

To blow out a brain, simply head over to these websites and choose the server you would like to play on. You should ensure you register your account before trying to use the server, this is to ensure you get credits. You earn credits by winning rounds that are fortunately enough it is free.

The credits can be used to purchase skins, or if you lose them all, the match will be over. The basic mechanics of the deathmatch server include weapon and health spawns, all of which depend on the server settings.

This means that certain weapon/health/armor spawns might not be available on a server, but that does not mean the server is bad. It is all about giving users a choice in the matter.

CS GO has captured the hearts of millions of people around the globe. As a matter of fact, statistics reveal that around 20 million people have experienced the thrill of this game.
