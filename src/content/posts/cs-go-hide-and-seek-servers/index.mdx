Hide and Seek is a game of.. well hide and seek.

It sounds simple enough, but there's more to it than meets the eye.

The person who is "it" typically has to find all the other people who are "hiding."

In CS GO Hide and Seek servers, they have some extra rules that make this challenging: you can't just shoot your way in!

That would be too easy. You have to use grenades as well as other weapons like the knife or even fists if necessary.

Be careful though, If you're hiding with your friends, don't let them see you because then they'll blow you up!

## What Is A CS GO HnS Server?

Hide and Seek or as it is more popularly called, One in the Chamber is quite a popular mode in CS GO. But unfortunately, the mode that has been casted in the pre-set scenario in the original game, does not include all the features this mode has to offer.

In the pre-set scenario of CS GO, the game includes 10 players out of which 6 are terrorists, and the rest are counter-terrorists. In order to make the game more interesting, the server has been modified to include more players and the maximum number is 15.

The game eliminates players one by one until there is just one player left. The one player left remaining becomes the winner, or until all the terrorists are killed. There are different servers available with different rules and different ways to play it. These servers offer different maps which have different options, and you can choose the one you like.

For example, you might want to choose one that lets you play without buying weapons. So, you have an option to not buy weapons. Another one might allow you to buy extra weapons. If you are truly a fan of this genre, then try playing it in CSGO.

Not only are the options incredible, you also get to practice aiming skills while displaying quick reflexes, and if you are lucky you might also come out as a winner.

With millions of players around the world, the game has earned it headlines and made it to the list of must-have games on steam However, as great as it may seem, CS GO has its limitations. Such limitations were then dealt with by offering players customizable community servers. As such, CS GO Hide and Seek Servers were born.

The pre-set length of maps or game modes might be overwhelming at times. And sometimes there might not be enough variety in maps and modes to keep you engrossed in the stock game.

With the same maps, same players and same matches, sometimes the game might seem to be a bit monotonous.

And if you are the kind of gamer who loves to play with different people, different maps and different modes, then CS GO hide and seek servers might be the perfect change for you.
