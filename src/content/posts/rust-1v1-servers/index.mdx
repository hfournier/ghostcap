## What Are Rust 1v1 Servers

Nothing beats the action and thrill of Rust 1v1 game mode. This captivating one-against-one match can be anyone's win as long as he or she is not caught unaware and kills the other player first.

However, finding a server exclusively focused on 1v1 gameplay is another issue altogether. Thus, it is in our best interests to not just play 1v1 on an online Rust server but search for those that offer Rust 1v1 gameplay exclusively. When you have such a private server for yourself, the trouble of playing the game can be significantly reduced.

Although the game has no specific objectives, we can set some for ourselves. If you want to enjoy private matches, then it is advisable to search for a server that is supporting stealth and hidden gameplay. You can also choose a server that is supporting long-range and close-range gameplay to make your match more dynamic and exciting.

Rust 1v1 servers have a maximum of 2 players or more as the maximum number of players. Players will play [PVP](https://www.ghostcap.com/rust-pvp-servers/) 1vs1 or 2vs1 depending on the server. Some servers will allow you to play 3vs1 or 2vs2 and even 4vs2.

This will depend on the availability of the server and the game type you want to choose. They are called servers because there is only one player or more on the server. They are also called lobbies because you will join a lobby there are multiple players.

Each server will have a large area to explore and mine and gives you the ultimate freedom to choose to make either base or harvest or find animals to tame. Just like any other online multiplayer game, Rust 1v1 servers are also servers.

## Conclusion

Playing online games is a lot of fun for most of us. But having to compete with other online players, not to mention the cheaters, makes it a pain to play. This is why 1v1 matches are created.

You get to enjoy the game with others (if the server allows you to) while avoiding all the hassle and bad feelings of losing to a cheater.  
Overall, if you want to enjoy your game, it is imperative to choose the right server. Not all servers are created equal. There are those that are dedicated to 1v1 as the maximum number of players while others are not.

Not just that, there are also those that offer 1v1 as the minimum or 2v2 or even 3v3. There are those who support custom servers while others are not. Since you get what you pay for, it is best to choose a server that suits your gaming experience.
