In the world of online gaming, few things are as frustrating as when you’re ready to play, but your server is nowhere to be found. This guide is dedicated to helping you troubleshoot and fix the issue of your Ark server not showing up. We’ll be focusing on the popular game Ark: Survival Evolved, and the issues that might prevent your server from showing up in the server list.

## Common Reasons for Ark Server Not Showing Up

If you find that your ARK server is not showing up in the in-game browser list, don't worry. This section will guide you through the steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue.

### Note Before You Start

Please be aware that servers can take between 5 to 10 minutes to start. You can confirm that the server has started when the CPU usage drops to around 50% and the RAM usage is at approximately 2-3GB.

### Keeping Up with Updates

ARK: Survival Evolved is known for frequent updates. In 2023, the game has been updating 4-5 times per day, and it's crucial to keep your server updated as well to ensure it shows up in the listing.

#### How to Update Your Server:

1.  Click "Stop" on your service.
2.  Click the "STEAM Update" button and wait for it to finish.
3.  Start your server.

If your server still doesn’t show up, the issue might be with the in-game browser listing. There is a known bug that sometimes prevents servers from being displayed to all users. This bug affects only the in-game browser and not the STEAM list.

### Using STEAM Server Listings

If the in-game browser is not showing your server, you can use the STEAM server listings as an alternative.

#### Step 1: Access the Server List

Right-click the STEAM icon on your PC and select "Servers".

#### Step 2: Navigate to the Internet Tab

Once the server window opens, click the "Internet" tab to view a list of servers.

#### Step 3: Adjust Your Settings

At the bottom of the window, change your settings to the following:

_Note: The settings are not specified, but usually, you would want to filter by game (ARK: Survival Evolved) and possibly region._

#### Step 4: Find and Join Your Server

Scroll through the server list to find your server. Once you find it, double-click on it to join.

### Contact Support

If none of these steps work, it's time to reach out for help. Please contact the support team of your server hosting service and provide them with the necessary details regarding your server.

By following this guide, you should be able to resolve the issue of your ARK server not showing up in the browser list and get back to enjoying the thrilling world of ARK: Survival Evolved.

## Tips for a Smooth Ark Experience

*   **Keep Your Mods Updated**: If you’re using mods in Ark, keep them updated. An outdated mod can prevent your server from showing up.
*   **Use Filters Wisely**: In the server browser, use filters to narrow down the list of servers. This helps to ensure that only the servers you’re interested in will show.
*   **Monitor Server Performance**: Regularly check the performance of your server. A server with low ping and good performance is more likely to show up in the server list.

In Ark: Survival Evolved, being able to connect to a server is crucial for the full gaming experience.
