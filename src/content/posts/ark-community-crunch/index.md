ARK: Survival Evolved is one of the top survival game that we have in the market these days. A primitive, fantasy adventure, this game is one of the best I've seen in recent years. But the game has a lot more to offer other than its plot, setting and action. In fact, the game employs a whole new breed of dinosaurs, prehistoric creatures and hybrid animals. Some of them include the Allosaurus, Dilopyus, Galliotan, Carnotaurus, T-Rex and the Brontosaurus. Right from the prehistoric ages to the ice-age, you'll find these fantastical species at work, offering unrestricted adventuring and survival fun.

And the best thing is, if you like a particular creature and wish to have your own, you can simply persuade it in becoming your buddy. Similarly, if there is a particular species that you don't like, you can simply kill it! But if you feel guilty about killing an innocent creature in the game, you can always tame it and have fun with it. Hatch, grow and nourish your monster, which can in turn protect you from enemies and other monsters. It's a two-way street, you see.

However, the whole game is solely dependent on the community. Developers will always provide ARK with new advancements to keep you entertained, but the community will always be the very heart of the game. If you love the game, provide your valuable feedback on the page and give them a motivation to continue with their deviant and development works!
