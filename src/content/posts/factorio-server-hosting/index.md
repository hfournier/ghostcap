## Things To Consider Before Buying A Factorio Server

By default, when you're just starting out, the Factorio server doesn't need many resources to run. However, once you start getting into a megabase, resources can start to spiral out of control. I would consider anything over 2000 construction bots starting to get into megabase territory. 

Our own personal GhostCap Factorio server using the Space Exploration mod uses 1 CPU thread, and 1.2 GB of RAM. That is currently a 150mb save file.

I suggest starting with the base plan of any provider and then upgrade your private server if you need. Most hosting providers will allow you to upgrade for free.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much RAM does a Factorio server need?

We suggest you get a server with at least 2GB of RAM. This will allow you to build a megabase without having to worry about upgrading.

### Does the server stay running 24/7?

Most Factorio server providers you pay money for stay running 24/7. This allows any player to join and leave as they please.

### How many players can a Factorio server support?

The number of players a Factorio server can support depends on the server's hardware and network capacity. On average, a well-configured server can support up to 100 players simultaneously.

### Is it possible to customize the game settings on a hosted Factorio server?

Yes, most Factorio server hosting providers allow you to customize game settings such as map generation, resource settings, enemy difficulty, and mod support.

### Can I use mods on a hosted Factorio server?

Yes, most Factorio server hosting providers support the use of mods. You can typically upload and manage mods through the hosting control panel.
