## Solo/Duo, What Is That?

A duo server basically refers to a server that is populated with a maximum of 10 players. In this set-up, players start their journey in a team of two or three after which only the fittest will survive and the others will be kicked out.

The duo servers, resulting in a team of 10, hence becomes the most populated one, and hence, the other servers that come under the solo category become little more than empty shells.

Duo servers are probably the best choice for both the experienced and the novice players as the former ones will enjoy the freedom of their gameplay as well as the reliability of their choices whereas the latter ones will find the duo servers a suitable environment for them to learn the tricks of survival.

## What Are Solo Servers?

The solo servers are different in comparison to the duo and the official ones as they offer an environment that is completely unrestricted, providing more space for creativity. If the duo servers are meant for the novice players, then the solo servers are the right place for the experienced players where they can make their own rules and play on the terms they decide.

The first important difference between the official and the solo servers is that in the former ones, the players are pretty much restricted to build only one house. But in the solo servers, they can build a village that can contain 10 to 100 or whatever number of houses they like.

Another distinctive difference between the duo and solo servers is that they have games that are dedicated and hence, they can be joined by anyone regardless of their rank and game progress.

In the vast realm of gaming, there are actually a very small number of games that provide the players with unlimited and unrestricted freedom, allowing them to do whatever they feel boasting all-out freedom in the virtual world.

Solo servers are simply dedicated servers that enable solo players to play in them. But unlike the official servers, the solo servers don't provide any VIP and Admin privileges and don't have any password-protected rooms.

They simply provide the players with an unrestricted environment with no rules whatsoever. But if you ever wondered whether it makes sense or not to play in such an environment, then you are at the right place. Once you play in to a solo server, you'll know what we are talking about.

In this article, our focus is to educate the players about several online platforms from where they can download the solo servers for their PC as well as for their smartphones. Before we jump in to the list of such servers, let's see the difference between solo and duo servers.

And while doing so, they can also build alliances with the other players, come up with a dream village, and create an army to protect their territory.

## Is A Solo Server In Rust Possible?

Now that you have understood the differences between the solo, duo, and official servers, the most common question coming to the players' mind is whether it is possible to play in the solo servers or not as there are people who believe that solo play is a paradox and something which is impossible in the game.

The answer is, yes, it is possible to play in the solo servers.

And if you are a player who can go solo, then you can play in the solo servers and experience the full freedom of the game right in the comfort of your home!
