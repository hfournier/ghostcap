description: 'Kit PVP is a unique and exciting server variation that allows players to fight against each other. Kit varieties allow for more creativity in battle by letting you choose between pre-set categories with their own unique items, but it also means choosing your kit can be as important—or even more so than what weapons or armor sets are chosen!'

Minecraft KitPVP tends to be one of the most exciting game modes, at least in our opinion, and that of many players who play nothing but PvP. The servers are primarily focused on enabling players to claim their kit with gear, which usually consists of weapons and armor but varying quality. Once players have claimed the kit, each one battles the other in what resembles a free for all stage to determine superiority.

Interestingly, many factors contribute to delivering the best Minecraft KitPVP experience, which includes a lag-free speed, a good balance of server hit detection, and kit availability.

We are often told that it is hard to find a decent Minecraft KitPVP server. However, in our experience, there are quite a few. Below is a list of the best Minecraft KitPVP servers in our experience, and just about every one of them is available 24/7.

## PURPLE PRISON

**IP: PURPLEPRISON.NET**

Purple Prison is one of the best Minecraft KitPVP servers out there with several game modes, which are part of the KitPvP experience. As soon as you join the server, it is possible to claim a PvP Kit, and it does not cost a dime. All you need is to type the kit command “/kit pvp.”

After players have claimed their PvP kit, they can jump into the arena and start taking part in the large team fights against everyone else.

As of this writing, Purple Prison is slightly over six years old but has become popular amongst YouTubers like PewDiePie.

## **VIPER MC**

Viper MC is another one of our favorites, with a vast KitPvP game mode, referred to as “kitmaps.” The players on the map can choose what kit they want out of the several options available. Each one of the options has its own set of strengths and weaknesses.

As always, once players have claimed their kit, they can enter onto the massive map and start gaining points by killing others.
