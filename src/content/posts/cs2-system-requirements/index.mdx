As the excitement builds for the new game, many players are wondering about the **system requirements for [Counter-Strike 2](https://www.ghostcap.com/cs2-release-date/)**. While Valve hasn't shared the exact details yet, we can speculate on what the requirements will be based on other **Source 2** titles such as [Dota 2](https://www.dota2.com/reborn/part3) and [Half-Life: Alyx](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Half-Life:_Alyx).

## Minimum System Requirements for CS2

Here are the **Counter-Strike 2 minimum system requirements**:

*   **OS**: Windows 10 64-bit operation system
*   **Processor**: Dual-core Intel or AMD processor at 2.8 GHz speed
*   **Memory**: 4GB of RAM
*   **Graphics**: GeForce GTX 650 or Radeon HD 7750 graphics card
*   **Storage**: 60GB of space (though the exact size of CS2 is currently 30.3 GB)

With these specifications, players can expect to hit the magic 60FPS mark, with drop-offs around interactive elements like Molotov fire or smoke grenades. For a casual player, 60FPS is plentiful when it comes to CS2, but if you're looking to **play CS2 competitively**, you're going to need a beefier rig.

## Counter-Strike 2 Recommended System Requirements

Here are some of the **recommended system requirements** we can expect from CS2, based on requirements for Half-Life: Alyx:

*   **Processor**: Core i5-7500 / Ryzen 5 1600
*   **Memory**: 12GB RAM
*   **Graphics**: GTX 1060 or RX 580 (at least 6GB VRAM)
*   **Storage**: 60GB of space

Pair a more powerful rig with a high refresh rate monitor (at least 144Hz or higher) and play around with graphics settings. You'll be looking to reach that refresh rate in FPS at the minimum (so 144FPS for 144Hz), which should be easily doable with the above equipment on low to medium settings.

## Our Testing: CS2 vs. CSGO Performance Analysis

In our quest to provide the most accurate and detailed information about **Counter-Strike 2**, we conducted a series of tests to compare the performance of CS2 with its predecessor, CSGO. These tests were conducted on specific hardware and settings to gauge how CS2 performs in different scenarios.

**Testing Hardware and Settings**

*   **Processor**: Intel 13900k
*   **Graphics Card**: GeForce 4090
*   **Resolution**: 1080p
*   **Anti-Aliasing**: No AA
*   **Map**: Dust 2

### Low Settings: CS2 vs. CSGO

On low settings, we found that CS2 was **25 - 30% slower** than CSGO. This performance drop indicates that the **minimum system requirements** for CS2 are indeed higher, and the game demands more from the hardware, especially in terms of **graphics** and **processor** capabilities.

### High Settings: CS2 vs. CSGO

When we cranked up the settings to high, CS2 was **10 - 20% slower** than CSGO. This smaller performance gap at higher settings suggests that CS2 has been optimized to provide a visually richer experience without a significant loss in performance, provided the **graphics card** and **CPU** are up to the task.

### CS2 Is Still CPU Bound

Interestingly, like CSGO, the game was **CPU bound** in our tests. This means that the **processor** was the limiting factor in the game's performance, rather than the **graphics card**. This is consistent with the nature of the **Source 2 engine**, which relies heavily on CPU performance.

## Valve's Approach to System Requirements

Valve historically doesn't announce certain **system requirements** until after a game is released. So, while we have some information based on other **Source 2 releases**, don't expect the official word on **Counter-Strike 2 system requirements** until closer to the **official release**.

## Storage and Size Requirements

With a **size requirement** of 60GB of space, players will need to ensure they have enough room on their **hard drive**. While the **exact size** of CS2 is currently 30.3 GB, it's good to leave a little extra room for custom elements like maps, models, and configs.

## Conclusion

The **Counter-Strike 2 minimum system requirements** and **recommended system requirements** are essential for players looking to enjoy the latest Counter-Strike installment.

Whether you're a casual player or looking to compete in **esports**, understanding the **system requirements for Counter-Strike 2** is crucial. Stay tuned and follow us for the **latest news** on CS2 and other **PC games**, and get ready to dive into the exciting world of Counter-Strike 2!
