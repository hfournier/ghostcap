Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the game, there might come a time when you need to change the language settings in [Valorant](https://www.ghostcap.com/cs2-vs-valorant/). This guide will walk you through the process step-by-step, providing additional tips and tricks along the way to enhance your gaming experience.

## Changing the Language In-Game

If you find yourself already in a game and want to change the language settings, don't worry. Valorant has made it easy for you to do so. Here's how:

1.  **Locate the Valorant Icon:** Look at the top left-hand corner of your screen. You will see the V icon, which stands for Valorant. Click on it to open a menu.
2.  **Access the Settings:** In the menu that appears, click on Settings. This will open up a plethora of customization features that Valorant offers.
3.  **Navigate to the General Tab:** Once you're in the Settings, make sure you're in the General tab. This is where you'll find the language settings.
4.  **Change the Text Language:** At the top of the General tab, you'll see the Text Language option. Click on the drop-down menu next to it and select the language you want to play in.

Remember, it's crucial to exit out of both the game and the client for the changes to take effect. This is a common mistake that players make, so ensure you don't fall into the same trap.

**Tip:** Familiarize yourself with the Settings menu. There are many other customization options that can enhance your gaming experience. For instance, you can adjust the graphics settings to optimize game performance or change the audio settings to suit your preferences.

## Changing the Language In-Client

If you prefer to adjust your language settings before you even start the game, Valorant has got you covered. Here's how you can do it:

1.  **Boot Up the Client:** When you start the Valorant client, you'll be taken to the sign-in screen.
2.  **Access the Settings:** Look for the Settings icon in the bottom-right of the screen. It looks like a little gear. Click on it to open the settings menu.
3.  **Change the Game Language:** In the settings menu, you'll see the Game Language option with a drop-down list. Select the language of your choice from this list.

Again, remember to exit out of both the client and the game if you had it open for the changes to take effect.

**Tip:** Changing the language in-client is especially useful if you share your gaming device with someone who prefers to play in a different language. This way, each player can enjoy the game in their preferred language.
