The HoloISO project on GitHub provides an archiso configuration for SteamOS 3, allowing it to be installed on a desktop PC using the Holo ISO.

The primary goal of SteamOS 3 (Holo) is to bring the Steam Deck's SteamOS Holo redistribution into a generic, installable format. This project aims to provide a close-to-official SteamOS experience, focusing on re-implementing proprietary components that the Steam client, OS itself, gamescope, and user-created applications for Deck rely on.

The HoloISO project is community-driven and open-source, inviting contributions from developers and enthusiasts. It's designed to function well on a wide range of hardware, including devices with AMD GPUs that support RADV Drivers instead of Radeon, and Intel iGPUs up to the 11th gen Iris Xe. However, it's important to note that NVIDIA GPUs are not currently supported.

Installation of SteamOS 3 (Holo) involves flashing the Holo ISO onto a 4GB flash drive, booting into the ISO, and following the on-screen instructions. Once installed, users will be greeted with the Steam Deck's OOBE screen, where they can connect to their network and log in to their Steam account. From there, users can seamlessly switch to the KDE Plasma desktop environment.

## Tiny 10 and Tiny 11

<Image decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" alt="TODO: update alt text" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src={__tiny_11_screenshot_webp} widths={[1024, 768]} />

Tiny 10 and Tiny 11 are customized versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11, respectively. They are designed to be lightweight and efficient, making them ideal for systems with limited resources or for users who prefer a streamlined Windows experience.

Tiny 10 and Tiny 11 achieve their lightweight nature by stripping down the original Windows versions to the essentials. This involves removing unnecessary features, services, and bloatware that are not critical for the core functionality of the operating system. As a result, these operating systems are able to run smoothly even on lower-end hardware, making them particularly appealing for older PCs or systems with limited resources.

For gamers, Tiny 10 and Tiny 11 can be an attractive option. By reducing the system overhead, these operating systems can potentially provide better performance in games, especially on systems where resources are a limiting factor. They support all the games that are compatible with Windows 10 and Windows 11, so gamers do not have to worry about compatibility issues.

However, it's important to note that because Tiny 10 and Tiny 11 are stripped-down versions of Windows, they might lack some features and functionalities found in the full versions. Additionally, being customized versions, they might not receive the same level of support and updates as the official Windows versions.

**Pros:**

*   Lightweight and efficient, ideal for lower-end PCs.
*   Supports all games that run on Windows 10 and 11.

**Cons:**

*   As stripped-down versions, they might lack some features found in the full versions of Windows.
*   Might not have the same level of support as the full versions.

## Ubuntu

<Image decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" alt="TODO: update alt text" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" src={__ubuntu_for_gaming_png} widths={[1920, 768, 1536]} />

Ubuntu is a popular Linux-based operating system known for its user-friendly interface and robust performance. It's developed by Canonical Ltd., with a focus on accessibility and open-source development.

Ubuntu is a versatile operating system that can run on a variety of hardware, from high-end gaming PCs to budget laptops. It's known for its stability and security, making it a popular choice for both personal and professional use.

For gamers, Ubuntu offers compatibility with a wide range of games, especially with the integration of Steam. This allows Ubuntu users to access a vast library of games, from indie titles to AAA games. Additionally, Ubuntu supports other gaming platforms like Lutris and GameHub, further expanding the gaming possibilities.

Ubuntu is also highly customizable, allowing users to tailor the OS to their needs. This includes the ability to choose from various desktop environments, such as GNOME, KDE, and XFCE, and to install a wide range of software from Ubuntu's extensive repositories.

However, it's important to note that not all games are compatible with Ubuntu, especially those that are exclusive to Windows. Some technical knowledge might also be required to fully utilize and customize Ubuntu.

**Pros:**

*   Offers a stable and efficient OS, ideal for both regular PC use and gaming.
*   Supports a wide variety of games, especially with the integration of Steam.
*   Highly customizable, allowing users to tailor the OS to their needs.

**Cons:**

*   Not all games are compatible, especially those exclusive to Windows.
*   Might require some technical knowledge to fully utilize.

## Mac OS

<Image decoding="async" width="2160" height="1350" alt="TODO: update alt text" sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px" src={__macos_243_3_2160x1350_jpg} widths={[2160, 768, 1536, 2048, 2560]} />

Mac OS, developed by Apple, is traditionally known for its sleek design and seamless integration with other Apple products. While not typically associated with gaming, recent developments have opened up new possibilities for gaming on Mac OS.

Apple's Game Porting Toolkit (GPTK) is a significant step towards enhancing the gaming experience on Mac OS. Announced at the company's WWDC, GPTK allows developers to test if their games could work well when ported to a Mac. This toolkit is available to anyone with a bit of work and MacOS Sonoma.

The GPTK requires a significant amount of setup and is less user-friendly compared to using Parallels or Crossover. However, the payoff, in terms of gaming performance, is considered worth it. The toolkit was tested on a MacBook Pro with the Apple M1 Pro, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage, and the results were impressive. Games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Spider-Man: Remastered were completely playable at around 30 FPS on high settings.

The GPTK works similarly to Proton on the Steam Deck. It uses Wine as a base to translate Windows API calls to POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) calls and then translates DirectX calls to Apple's Metal API. Wine recreates a Windows directory structure and provides alternative implementations of system services. It doesn't use any emulation or virtualization to execute Windows binaries. On Apple Silicon, it takes an additional step to translate from x86 to Arm.

While the GPTK is primarily aimed at developers to test their games and incentivize them to develop for Mac, it's clear that if you're willing to get your hands dirty, it can be worth it to set up GPTK and play Windows-based games on your Mac. This development suggests that a wide range of games could potentially be playable on Mac OS in the future.

**Pros:**

*   Increasing number of games are becoming compatible with Mac OS.
*   Seamless integration with other Apple products and services.

**Cons:**

*   Not as many games available compared to Windows or Linux.
*   Hardware is not as customizable as PCs, limiting potential upgrades.
