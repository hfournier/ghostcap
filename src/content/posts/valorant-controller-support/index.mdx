Developed by Riot Games, Valorant was designed from the ground up to be a PC title and has been a huge success since it launched its closed beta. The popularity of the game has [grown so much](https://technology.riotgames.com/news/scalability-and-load-testing-valorant) that even console players who enjoy using controllers rather than a keyboard and a mouse want to give it a try.

Since Valorant is a game you play using your keyboard and mouse, the question is can you have the option to play Valorant with a controller? Just like how you can play your favorite games like Call of Duty and Apex Legends on consoles? The answer is yes, but with limitations, as Riot Games have no official controller support yet to play Valorant.

And in this guide, I'll walk you through how you can set up your console platforms, be it an Xbox controller, PlayStation, or Switch as a replacement for a keyboard and mouse when you play Valorant.

## How to Set Up Controller Support in Valorant

One way to set up your controller as a replacement for the keyboard and mouse is to use a third-party controller mapping app software like reWASD.

It has become one of the most popular tools among gamers due to its ease of use and customization options. You can use this software for free or you can upgrade to its Pro version.

Follow these simple steps to set up your controller to play Valorant.

*   Download [reWASD](https://www.rewasd.com/).
*   Once the software is downloaded, restart your computer.
*   Connect the controller device to your computer.
*   Open Valorant and reWASD.
*   Input and map the key binds in reWASD based on your Valorant settings. You also have to choose the specific controller in reWASD, if it's Xbox, Playstation, or Switch. From there you can fully customize the controller inputs based on your preference.

While it is easy to set up your controller, one thing to note when playing Valorant game with a controller is to avoid macro key binds. In most games, the use of macro key binds is bannable, so Valorant is no exception.

## Limitations on Valorant Controller Support

Since Riot Games is yet to launch its official controller full support in the near future, you cannot play Valorant with a controller without using a software configuration such as reWASD.

Playing precision-based games such as Valorant with a controller can be very challenging without an aim assist. Aim assist support is available to console players when playing other FPS games such as Call of Duty and Apex Legends. To play the game Valorant requires high sensitivity and precise movements, so using a keyboard and a mouse would be awesome for good aim compared to using controllers.

[Riot Vanguard](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/dev/valorant-anti-cheat-what-why-and-how/), the Riot Games' anti-cheat system, may falsely flag your account as well when using third-party software. So be very careful as it may result in banning and suspending your Valorant account.

## Conclusion

While it's an option to use a controller to play Valorant, we do not recommend it as it is not all that easy as opposed to using a keyboard and mouse. If you are really into consoles, let's hope Riot Games launch its official controller support as soon as possible!

But if you really love and enjoy playing Valorant, why not give your mouse and keyboard a try? As a rookie in FPS gaming, I can still remember how I struggled with using my keyboard and mouse. Heck, I can't even press the WASD button and can't move my mouse properly! It took me a lot of practice and a learning curve before I get used to it! So maybe you'll end up loving it anyway, though you have to spend some time getting used to it!
