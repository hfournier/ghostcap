No matter what your interests are, there is a Minecraft Roleplay server for you.

There are Minecraft servers that focus on medieval-era roleplays, modern-day roleplays with cops and robbers, zombie apocalypses, or even historical time periods like the Roman Empire.

No matter what you're into as far as stories go, there's a RPG server out there for you!

In this post, I'll go over what I think are the 7 best Minecraft RP servers.

## 8 Best Minecraft Roleplay Servers

In this day and age of video games, the concept of role-playing has largely become an integral part of the industry.

Many games are still evolving with the advent of new technology and faster Internet connections, which has made it easier for users to create new accounts from anywhere in the world. Still, there is one game that beats them all.

Itâ€™s the Minecraft universe. Players have been exploring this vast, captivating universe for a long time. Not only that, but Minecraft is also the perfect game for roleplayers. It is constantly evolving and adding new characters. Moreover, the fact that the game is in-house and in a completely different dimension, means you are rather anonymous.

That is exactly what roleplayers look for in a game.

That being said, the Minecraft world is vast, and there are many different kinds of servers out there. Some are more suitable for roleplaying than others.

Every RPG server may look good and interesting, but since there are many of them, the first challenge is to locate a working roleplaying server that suits your exact requirement.
