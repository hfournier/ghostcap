Attack Of The B-Team is mainly a pack of mods for Minecraft, which were picked by two leading YouTube personalities, i.e., [GenrikB](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJTWU5K7kl9EE109HBeoldA) and [BDoubleO100](https://www.youtube.com/c/bdoubleo) also referred to as the B-Team.

Players can download the b team modpack from the [Technic Platform](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/attack-of-the-bteam.552556), the creators of other popular packs like Tekkit and Hexxit.

Technic says that Attack Of The B-Team was mainly designed with crazy mad science in mind. That's why they picked out the wackiest mods and put them all together for people to enjoy.

Some of the cool stuff players can do in the game is morphing into the shape of any mob you kill, getting attacked by a zombie wearing a top hat, and weird-looking trees. In other words, this isn't your Vanilla Minecraft Server.
