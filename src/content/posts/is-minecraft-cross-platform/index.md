### Minecraft: Java Edition

This is the original version of Minecraft developed for PC (Windows, Mac, Linux). It has its own set of features, updates, and [community mods](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft). However, cross-play is limited in the Java Edition. Players can only join servers with other Java Edition players.

### Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

The Bedrock Edition, initially designed for mobile and console platforms, is the version that promotes cross-platform play. It includes the Windows 10 Edition, versions for consoles like Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, as well as for mobile devices (iOS and Android).

## How to Play Minecraft Cross-Platform

Now that we understand the different versions of Minecraft let's delve into the how-to guide on playing cross-platform. Remember, cross-platform play is only possible with the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft.

### Step 1: Purchase and Install Minecraft Bedrock Edition

Ensure all players who wish to play together have the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft installed on their respective platforms.

### Step 2: Create a Microsoft Account

All players need to create a free Microsoft account. This account is essential for Minecraft's cross-play feature to work.

### Step 3: Add Friends on Microsoft

Add each other as friends on Microsoft. You can do this by selecting 'Add Friend' and then entering your friend's Microsoft Gamertag.

### Step 4: Launch Minecraft and Join a Game

Launch Minecraft and sign in with your Microsoft account. One player will need to start a game, and others can join by going to the 'Friends' tab and selecting the friendâ€™s game they wish to join.

Remember, for players to join a game, the host must have the multiplayer setting enabled. This setting is found under 'Settings' > 'Multiplayer' > 'Multiplayer Game'.

### Step 5: Enjoy Cross-Platform Play

Once all friends have joined the game, you can start your Minecraft adventure together, no matter the platform each person is using.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, while Minecraft's cross-platform capabilities have some restrictions based on the game's edition, it is entirely possible to enjoy a Minecraft gaming session with friends across different platforms with the Bedrock Edition.

This cross-platform feature has undoubtedly contributed to Minecraft's ongoing popularity, enabling players worldwide to collaborate, compete, and create in the Minecraft universe without letting platform boundaries hinder their fun.
