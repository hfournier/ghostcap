MineZ Servers offer a unique multiplayer zombie survival experience for seasoned Minecraft players. The servers have been inspired by Arma DayZ, which is great for people who want to experience something different.

As a Minecraft MineZ player, your goal is to defend the designated territory against hordes of zombies and gather as many resources as possible. That means you're encouraged to explore the post-apocalyptic world and show off your fighting skills on these servers.

Unfortunately, finding live MineZ servers, as we soon found out, was a little challenging. Also, the serves which were live didn't have many active players.

Since the goal is to protect your people and territory, ideally, you will want to play on a server with many players. Below is our selection of the best MineZ servers we could find and play out, which offered the best experience.

## The Mining Dead

IP: hub.miningdead.com

Now, if you are a fan of AMC's The Walking Dead, we can guarantee that you will want to play on this server. You will fight off groups of walkers or loners with melees, guns and even team up with a boatload of other players on the server. Fortunately for players, this is one of the few mineZ severs where there are dozens of players at any given time. Plus, they have a pretty active community.

In addition, players can choose from 30 unique kits and get into their new 5000 map. Test your metal against hordes of zombies on this server.

## YN - MC DAYZ

IP: play.yomnetwork.ca

We love playing mineZ on MC DAYZ because it is a mode based on the famous DayZ, Escape from Tarkov, and Rust series of games. The objective of this mineZ server is to survive this otherwise dangerous world while trying to make it to evac without getting killed, but with all the loot you can carry.

You will be faced by a wild open-world, PvE, PvP, and lots of bosses. The server has over 80 players online, actively playing games at any given time in our experience. That's why it's easier to find people to play with and enjoy mineZ the way it was meant.

## Purplekingdoms.com

IP: 192.99.193.52

The Purple Kingdom is a new faction with a creative plot server that offers plenty of room for everyone to build and explore. At the time we started playing, there was a lack of factions or players, but we know that things would soon change. It is a server that has gained a great deal of popularity over the past few weeks for its builds, raids, sieges, etc., so keep your eye on this one.

## Shotbow

IP: play.shotbow.net

Shotbow is home to a pretty healthy list of custom-coded game modes, including SMASH, MineZ, Mine Theft auto, SMASH, etc. The good news is that you don't need mods, and you can connect with version 1.12.2 â€“ 1.16.4.

Shotbow has over a million players, with the popularity of its servers growing exponentially. That's why it is one of the most fun mineZ servers you can log into, in our opinion.
