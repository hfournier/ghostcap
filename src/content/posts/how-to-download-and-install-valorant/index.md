## Is Valorant Free To Play?

Yes, Valorant is 100% free to play and Riot Games only makes money off in-game purchases. All you need to play Valorant is a PC and a Riot Account.

## Can You Download Valorant On Mac OS/Steamdeck/Xbox/PS5 Etc?

Not natively no. The reason for this is that Valorants anti-cheat is highly invasive to your system and requires kernel access. This is simply not possible right now on operating systems other than Windows.

Right now Riot Games Valorant is only supported on PC with no current plans to bring the game to other platforms.

With that said you can run Valorant on a Mac but only if you use Bootcamp however the performance won't be great on newer M1 varients.

## Is It Possible To Install Valorant Without A Riot Account?

You're able to download and install Valorant without a Riot account by simply going to the bottom of the Valo home page and clicking "Download Game Client".

However, it's worth noting, that you must have a Riot Games account to launch and play the game.

This is handy if your installing Valorant on a family or friend's PC and you don't have their account details yet.
