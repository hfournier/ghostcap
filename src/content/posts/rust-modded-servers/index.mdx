## What To Look For In A Modded Rust Server

### Frequency of updates

This is the major factor that will determine your ability to play on modded servers. The larger the number of updates that are applied, the better it will be for you. The idea of hosting a modded server is to ensure that you don't have to wait for the game to be playable after every patch. Ideally, a modded server should be updated at least every month.

### Quality

This is yet another important factor that will determine the standard of gameplay on the server. You don't want one that has a history of frequent disconnection.

### Stability

You don't want a server that keeps on crashing after every 33 minutes of gameplay, or even worst, a server that kicks you out of the server after you have logged in!

### Size

You don't want a server that is so small that you don't feel the game. Ideally, the modded servers should be populated to an extent where you feel like you are part of the action, make sure to find a map that is at least 3500 in size.

### Popular

There are many people that would love to be on a popular server; it attracts a lot of people. That, however, does not mean you should sacrifice your overall experience at the altar of popularity.

Using the mentioned guide will definitely help you find the best rust modded servers that will help you play in your own way.

## Types Of Rust Modded Rust Servers

### 10x Modded Servers

This is one of the more popular styles of Rust modded servers. This particular style of server has been designed so that the map is small to provide action but still with a variety of monuments, which means that more people are likely to get killed as they keep fighting.

The fundamental rule of 10x is survival, and because of that, you need to make sure you stay above the others. The best way of doing that is by quickly building a base, and flying under the radar of stronger players.Â  10x servers often come with the following features:

*   Comes with little to no rules.
*   The game only lasts for 5-7 days
*   You have the ability to teleport
*   Night and day cycle is changed (Usually around 50/10 cycle)
*   Additional Anti-Cheat
*   Dramatically increased stack sizes (30-70X increase)
*   BetterLoot mod (You get dramatically better loot around the map)
*   Airdrops are faster
*   Attack Helicopter is stronger
*   /remove tools

Here is a modded server with active admins, anti-cheat, and quality of life mods all rolled into one. The fastest up and coming 10x modded server in the US. Click [**here**](steam://connect/usa1.ghostcap.com:28015) to check it out!

### Battlefield Servers

Battlefield server deserves its name because it's just that. A server designed to be a battlefield. With no regard for wasting time running monuments and gathering resources, this server does its best to focus on [PVP](https://www.ghostcap.com/rust-pvp-servers/) and raiding. With very little time spent building a base and finding resources. Typically these servers start at 1000X normal resource rates and will offer constantly redeemable kits that have way too many resources in them. Here are a few other things that make these battlefield servers so special:

*   Very short modded cool-downs (TP's and Kits)
*   Short bed timer
*   Insta Kits (Automatically spawn with tools and weapons)
*   Very fast airdrops
*   Ideally constant action everywhere on the map
*   large group sizes
*   Smaller map sizes (No need for monuments)

### Building Servers

This server is very popular among the part of the community that loves to know exactly how many resources are needed to build their ideal base that has the most room and best protection possible. Typically always a PVE server, the types of mods this server offers are very useful. Allowing players to have admin powers such as flying, invincibility, instant spawn resources, and many more:

*   Infinite resources
*   Instant craft
*   God mode
*   Blueprint saves and loads
*   Player and building protection
*   Opt-in PVP
*   Large map size
*   No Clip
*   Remove hotkey

### 3X Modded Servers

These types of modded servers are for those who don't usually have a lot of time to mess around finding resources but also don't want to have to deal with massive bases that are found on the 10X servers. Offering a good mix of quality of life mods and moderate resource gain, Rust 3X servers are great for those only looking to play for the weekend that most servers wipe on. Here are a few of the mods these servers offer:

*   3X Resource gain
*   Stack size increased (Usually around 5-10X)
*   Reduced/ no radiation
*   Changed day/night cycle
*   Better loot plugin
*   Kits and player teleport (Heavily nerfed)
*   Average map size (typically 3500)

### 2X Vanilla Servers

Many people love playing the game as was intended by the developers, however, think that it is just a little too hard to gather resources. The very popular 2X vanilla servers are basically exactly the same as typical rust vanilla with 1 small change. 2X resources and stack size, that's usually about it. While it is listed under modded servers, it won't offer any other the other additional extras such as kits, teleport, or remove tools. Here is the very short list of changes you will typically find in 2X vanilla servers:

*   2X resources
*   2X stack sizes

## Conclusion

The top Rust modded servers mentioned above have been played by many players worldwide. These servers are always up, which means that you never experience connection problems.

You can jump into any of the servers and start playing without worrying about the problems you might encounter.

Another interesting thing is that basically, all popular servers have active admins that are checking their servers daily for any issues such as hackers, bugs, and performance issues.
