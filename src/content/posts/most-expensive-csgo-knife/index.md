Knife skins are some of the most expensive weapon skins in all of CS2.

Having some of the rarest knives instantly upgrades you to the highest level of competitive gameplay.

Everyone will see your skin in-game and know not to mess with you.

All jokes aside, CS2 knives are pretty awesome, but some are more expensive than others.

In this post we will look at the most expensive CS2 knife you can buy.

## What Makes factory New Karambit Case Hardened with a perfect blue gem pattern so expensive?

Why did the most expensive CS2 knife get valued at over 1.5 million dollars?

Just like any supply and demand curve, it comes down to rarity.

The one-of-a-kind Factory new, case-hardened skin, karambit (Curved blade) in and of itself is a hard-to-find and expensive knife. However, what sets this one apart from the rest is the hints of blue within the knife.

In this case hardened blue gem has a 100% blue shade; making it an extremely rare knife skin.

So rare that it is one of a kind.

With all of these factors culminating into one knife skin, it's easy to see how its value is so high.

## How much did the Karambit Case Hardened with a perfect blue gem pattern sell for?

The karambit case hardened skin was valued at over 1.5 million back in September of 2021. An offer of 1,2 million euros worth of bitcoin (Just over 22 bitcoins at that time).

With the owner and potential buyer wanting to remain private throughout the purchasing phase it is hard to dig deeper into the exact conversations but what we know is a middleman (ohnepixel2) had brief conversations with the owner letting them know of the large offer about and they decided to state "Not Interested, 1.2 is low".

Making this the most expensive knife skin, not only in Counter-Strike but also in every computer game ever.

## How rare is the Karambit Case Hardened with a perfect blue gem pattern?

It's easy to ask what are the chances of getting this knife in a random box drop.

I could just say their chance is very very low.

But let's break it down.

Assuming you are unboxing the correct case and there have been over 930 million cases unboxed then the chances of you getting the rarest knife is 0.00000010695%!

Needless to say, this is probably never going to drop again.

Remember, it also needs to come with a 100% blue gem color and a wear rating of 0.0480 or better.

## What Case did the Karambit Case Hardened with a perfect blue gem pattern come from?

The 2013 CSGO Weapons Case was the first case for the skin to come out. There are a few other cases you can find expensive knives, including:

*   Weapon Case
*   Weapon Case 2
*   Weapon Case 3
*   eSports 2013 Case
*   eSports 2013 Winter Case
*   eSports 2014 Summer Case
*   Revolver Case
*   Operation Bravo Case
*   Operation Phoenix Weapon Case
*   Operation Vanguard Weapon Case
*   Winter Offensive Weapon Case

Released on the 14th of August, 2013, the Karambit case-hardened skins quickly became one of the more popular choices for unboxers.

The one-of-a-kind blue gem came out of these boxes with a wear rating of 0.0480 and the pattern template 387.

## Who owns the most expensive CS2 knife?

As of 2023, valued at over 1.5 million dollars, the current owner "青い王" (Who is Chinese) and the name translates to Blue King.

The collector is very private and only talks to very select people who are also secretive about who they speak with, especially regarding this knife skin.

## Why Are Blue Gems So Expensive?

It comes down to demand and supply. With such a limited supply of perfect/near-perfect knives with such specific requirements, it makes it hard for new knives to make their way onto the market.

This, along with what very rich collectors personally find appealing is what also increases the prices. In this case, expensive knife skins come down to who is willing to increase the bid as the supply will remain unchanged.

Some, so-called, experts on the counter-strike scene claim this karambit knife has the ability to surpass $1.7 million within the coming year. Allowing it to, by far, keep the title of the most expensive CS2 knife.

## How much are CS:GO knives worth?

Counter-Strike is well-known for its cosmetics trading. Some skins have been sold for more than $100,000, however, Karambit Hardened Knife is rumored to cost up to $180,000. Typically, a knife goes for $100 - $200, which is why people go crazy when they open one in a case (A standard case key costs around $2).
