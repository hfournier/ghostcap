At The Game Awards 2020, Studio Wildcard, the creator of ARK: Survival Evolved, surprised fans worldwide with the announcement of ARK 2. The cinematic trailer gave us a glimpse into the new world, featuring none other than Hollywood actor Vin Diesel, known for his roles in the Fast and the Furious franchise and as Groot in the Guardians of the Galaxy films. Diesel isn’t just a celebrity cameo; he's deeply involved in the project as an executive producer, ensuring the sequel is something truly special.

## ARK 2: What We Know So Far

### The Setting and Story

While the first ARK was loosely narrative-based, ARK 2 promises a more story-oriented approach. From the cinematic trailer, we can infer that the game continues the dinosaur-ridden theme but with a more prominent focus on the human element. The setting appears to be a dangerous and primitive world where survival is paramount.

### Gameplay Mechanics

ARK 2 aims to retain the core mechanics of survival, crafting, and combat from its predecessor while introducing new elements to enhance the player's experience. The game is expected to bring in a more nuanced and immersive crafting system, more engaging combat mechanics, and a detailed environmental interaction system.

### Multiplayer

Multiplayer was a significant part of ARK: Survival Evolved. Players could form tribes, work together to survive, and even wage wars against other tribes. It is expected that ARK 2 will continue this tradition, with enhancements to make multiplayer interactions more dynamic and rewarding.

### Dinosaurs

ARK would not be ARK without dinosaurs. While the sequel has not revealed the full roster of creatures, the trailer has showcased several dinosaur species, indicating that these majestic and fearsome creatures will continue to play a crucial role in ARK 2.

ARK 2 and its accompanying animated series offer a unique opportunity to deepen the lore and narrative threads of the ARK universe. It's a chance to explore the history, cultures, and stories of this dinosaur-ridden world in greater detail, providing fans with a more immersive and engaging experience.

The anticipation for ARK 2 is palpable. As we wait for more information and eventually the release of the game, speculation will continue to run rampant. The community eagerly awaits new trailers, gameplay reveals, and developer diaries to glean more about this promising sequel.

ARK 2 has the potential to redefine the survival genre, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in terms of story, gameplay, and community interaction. The stage is set for an epic adventure — a journey of survival, discovery, and dinosaurs.

In the meantime, fans can replay ARK: Survival Evolved, speculate on the forums, and watch the animated series to get their ARK fix.
