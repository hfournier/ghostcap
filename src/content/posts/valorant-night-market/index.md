As a seasoned Valorant player, I've come to appreciate the thrill that the Night Market brings. It's a distinctive feature in the game that presents us with the chance to snag some exclusive weapon skins at a reduced price. The catch? The Night Market only showcases six random weapon skins that you won't find in the regular store. The randomness of the selection makes every Night Market experience a unique adventure.

I still remember when the Night Market made its debut in Valorant back in December 2020. Since then, it's become an event that I, along with many other players, eagerly anticipate. It usually pops up with every new act, which translates to a new Night Market roughly every two months. But remember, the exact dates aren't set in stone, so it's always a good idea to keep an eye on the in-game announcements.

In this guide, I'm going to share my insights and experiences with the Valorant Night Market, covering everything from its schedule to the variety of new skins you might stumble upon.

## How Does the Night Market Work?

Navigating the Night Market is an experience in itself. When it's active, a prompt pops up on the left-hand side of the main menu. I've found myself eagerly clicking on this prompt, which whisks me away to a special section of the store. Here, I'm greeted by six random weapon skins, each one a surprise.

What makes the Night Market truly special is that each player's selection is unique, tailored to the skins they don't already own. I've found some of my favorite skins here, all offered at a discount. It's a fantastic opportunity to expand your collection without breaking the bank. But keep in mind, the Night Market won't offer more than two skins for the same weapon.

Once you've made your selection, you can purchase your chosen skins using Valorant Points. Remember, the Night Market will last for two weeks, so don't wait until the last minute to make your purchase!

## Predicted Dates for Future Valorant Night Markets

While Riot Games has not officially announced the exact dates for future Valorant Night Markets, we can make some educated predictions based on the pattern observed so far. The Night Market typically appears every act, which lasts about two months. Therefore, we can expect the Night Market to return approximately every two months.

Here are some predicted dates for future Valorant Night Markets:

*   Act 2 of Episode 7: August 2023
*   Act 3 of Episode 7: October 2023

The Night Market offers a variety of skins, including Deluxe, Exclusive, and Premium Edition tiers. However, Ultra Edition skins won't appear in the Night Market. The skins are selected from different weapons, ensuring a diverse selection for players.

It's also worth noting that the Night Market skins are purely cosmetic and won't offer any competitive advantage. They're simply a fun way to customize your weapons and show off your style in-game.
