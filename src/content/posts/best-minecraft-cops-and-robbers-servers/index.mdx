Minecraft Cops And Robbers is a bit of a twist on the traditional cops and robbers games we used to play as kids. Instead of cops chasing robbers, there is only one cop, and he is the warden of a prison; everyone else is a prisoner.

The warden dictates everything from when they eat at the canteen to when the lights need to go off.

Minecraft Cops And Robbers is amongst the most popular and fun Minecraft minigame servers. However, it requires playing on a server with lots of other players. That’s why we’ve picked servers with the most possible players, no lag, and excellent customer service.
