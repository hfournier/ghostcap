## VPS Game Server Hosting Questions

We compiled some of the most common questions about starting your first game VPS.

### Is A Virtual Private Server Or Dedicated Server Better For Gaming?

When selecting a VPS provider, you may notice they offer dedicated servers too. The main difference between the two is that a VPS is a shared server, meaning you only get a slice of a single server.

However, a dedicated server means you have access to the entire server's resources.

For the most part, shared hosting is perfectly fine for most people who want to host game servers, and for the most part, it won't affect your gaming experience for players. Most VPS providers offer instant setup on their shared hosting plans.

The only time you would go with a dedicated is if you're planning to run a large public server, and need low latency and strong DDoS protection on the internet connection.

### Is VPS good for gaming?

A VPS server is good for gaming if you don't have the ability to buy dedicated hosting.

A gaming VPS is the first step above-[shared game hosting](https://www.ghostcap.com/game-server-hosting/) where you get access to a slice of a [dedicated server](https://www.ghostcap.com/best-dedicated-game-servers/).

### What is better than a VPS?

A dedicated server is better than a VPS.

A VPS is a Virtual Private Server where you get access to a slice of resources on a dedicated server. A dedicated server means you get access to all the resources and you don't need to share them with anyone.

### Can you run Minecraft on a VPS?

Yes, you can run Minecraft on a VPS. Out of all the games you can host using a VPS, Minecraft responds well with VPS hosting.

### Should you use VPS hosting?

If you can't afford a dedicated server, VPS hosting is the next best option for game hosting.

With a VPS plan you're sharing resources with other users on the same shared server, however, with a dedicated server you get access to the entire server for yourself.

### What Is The Disadvantage Of A VPS?

The main disadvantage of a VPS game server is that it tends to be more expensive than shared game hosting. A hosting company is able to run many shared game instances that support many online players, however, with a VPS, they're selling the resources of that machine to you.

### Why is a VPS so laggy?

There are many reasons why a VPS would be laggy and they include  
\- Overloaded server.  
\- Not enough resources allocated to the VPS.  
\- Configuration error.

Due to the nature of a VPS, even though you may have a good ping value, you still might experience lag in your gaming experience.

## Conclusion

If you're serious about game servers and really want a VPS for gaming, [then start with Vultr](https://www.ghostcap.com/vultr-review/). In my opinion, they offer the best ping for the lowest price.
