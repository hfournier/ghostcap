Playing Minecraft adventure is mainly exploring other player-created maps. It is one of the most exciting game modes because you don’t know what to expect with each new adventure.

Now, if you play Vanilla Minecraft, there is no quest, but once you shift into adventure mode, you will encounter designers who have developed a game with a lead player who needs to work through a story.

Game creators or adventure mode creators, as they are called, are required to think through various scenarios. For instance, when playing Minecraft Adventure, players need to use the right tools to break more blocks, and in some instances, blocks can’t be broken.

That’s why the adventure mode is an excellent way of engaging in building challenges or maybe telling a story because players can easily break blocks if they want to bypass some content.

If you are a fan of Minecraft Adventure mode or would like to explore more worlds, you need to connect to a server. Fortunately, there are quite a few, and we list the best ones below.

## 5 Best Adventure Servers For Minecraft

Adventure servers are servers that usually have Hardcore difficulty enabled, meaning that they do not pause if the player's character dies. These servers incorporate a lot of PvP mechanics to create an intense gameplay experience.

For example, a server may have a pass-time mechanic that gives players a set time before being "assassinated," where the player is teleported to an arena and must fight for their life against every enemy they've slain previously. Or maybe even spawn in items like diamond swords or food.

What happens on these servers depends on the server rules and the developers of each unique server. Here are the top 5 Best Minecraft Adventure Servers.

## What Are Minecraft Adventure Servers?

Adventure Minecraft servers are all very popular because of how intense they can be; there's no room for error and any misstep could mean certain death! Fear and anxiety can make gameplay more fun than ever, especially when you're pitted up against other players who want nothing more than to kill you and steal your loot.

As you play Adventure servers more and more, you'll get better and learn the mechanics of each different Adventure Server. What you'll find is that most servers have a lot in common with each other when it comes to rules and mechanics, but the maps themselves might be a little different depending on what developers they hold.

What you can expect from Adventure Servers is a very fast-paced, intense server where players must work together or risk being killed by one another. PvP is usually enabled throughout the whole map, but you may also come across NPCs who are not fond of your presence and will kill you if they get the chance!

What makes Minecraft Adventure servers so much fun is that there's no knowing what to expect next! You could spawn up somewhere nice and serene or in an arena surrounded by lava with every enemy you've slain surrounding you… What will you find?

Some of the most famous Minecraft Adventure servers are the ones that provide unique experiences, so even people who aren't normally PvP can have fun! What's interesting about the Adventure servers is that because of how much they limit your resources and give you a set time, it forces players to work together and cooperate.

What I mean by this is that even if you hate PvP and normally avoid anything to do with it, you'll still have to team up with somebody in order to succeed. What makes Minecraft Adventure Servers so great is their ability to accommodate any type of player--simply find a server that sounds fun for you!

When playing these types of servers, be prepared for something fast-paced! Don't waste too much time in one place or else enemies may spawn around you… Always keep moving! There are no rules except don break other people's stuff without permission.

## How We Defined The Best Minecraft Adventure Servers?

We admit that the “best” is a relative term and mainly depends on what you want. Each server has several adventures. You can also choose how many players to play with, and how many enemies you have as well as their difficulty, etc.

## Conclusion

That's it for our list of the Best Minecraft Adventure Servers. Have something we need to add? Leave a comment below!
