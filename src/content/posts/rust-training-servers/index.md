## How Do You Practice Aim In Rust?

Just like any FPS (CSGO, [Valorant](https://www.ghostcap.com/valorant-ranks/), PUBG) having good aim can almost always beat any other advantage you can have over your opponent. Sure you might not know the map very well or understand how to properly play as a team but that almost doesn't matter if you have better aim than the enemy. Rust is no different, ensuring you land more hits than your opponent basically guarantees a positive outcome.

It is because of this that many communities have created their own version of rust training servers. This is designed to **practice your aim** by providing stationary/ moving targets at a variety of ranges, heights and introducing variables such as weather and obstacles.

You can also join a [Rust PVE server](https://www.ghostcap.com/rust-pve-servers/) versus AI enemies. This is a great way to learn to aim without having someone outplay you.
