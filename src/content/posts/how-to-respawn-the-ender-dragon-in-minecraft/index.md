3.  Place 4 Ender Pearls in the middle square of the crafting table. And combine with 2 stacks of blaze powder. It should be the Eye of Ender which you can move to your inventory.
4.  To craft the four end crystals place an Eye of Ender in the middle square. Put the 4 Ghast Tears in the bottom middle square and the four glass blocks in the surrounding boxes or squares. A purple end crystal icon would appear by the side. You can tap or click it to your inventory. Do this for the remaining crystal till you have four eyes of ender.
