## How To Install CS2 Plugins With Metamod

[**Edit: I now have a full guide on how to install CS2 plugins**](https://www.ghostcap.com/how-to-install-cs2-plugins/)

Installing CS2 plugins is pretty straight forward and almost the same as CSGO. In fact, some game hosts such as [Game Host Bros](https://www.gamehostbros.com/cs2-server-hosting/) (that I own) support installing mods right from their dashboard. I would check to make sure they don't already have a Metamod installer there first, as it might be better for you to use that.

<Image decoding="async" width="2160" height="969" alt="TODO: update alt text" sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px" src={__Game_Host_Bros_GCG_CS2_RETAKE_AU_Mod_Manager_2160x969_png} widths={[2160, 768, 1536, 2048, 4082]} />

If they don't have a mod install, or you're self-hosting your own CS2 server, here is how you install plugins on your vanilla CS2 server.

1.  Download Metamod
2.  Extract and copy the Metamod `/addons/` directory to `/game/csgo/`
3.  Inside `/game/csgo/`, locate `gameinfo.gi`
4.  Open it in notepad and look for the line " `Game_LowViolence csgo_lv // Perfect World content override`"
5.  Create a new line underneath and add " `Game csgo/addons/metamod`"
6.  Restart your game server and type "`meta list`" to see if it works. If it says unknown command, then check you copied the Metamod addons folder to the correct location.
7.  Download the plugin you want to use and extract it.
8.  Copy all the files inside to `/game/csgo/metamod/`
9.  Restart the server again and type "`meta list`" to see if the plugin is loaded

Each plugin will have its own install instructions, but this is going to cover 99% of plugins that you install.
