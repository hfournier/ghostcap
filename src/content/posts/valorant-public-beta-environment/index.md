Valorant, the popular first-person shooter game developed by Riot Games, has taken the gaming world by storm. With its unique blend of tactical shooting and ability-based gameplay, it has quickly become a favorite among gamers. But did you know that there's a way to experience new features and changes before they're released to the public? Welcome to the Valorant Public Beta Environment (PBE).

## What is the Valorant Public Beta Environment?

The Valorant PBE is a test server where Riot Games tests new updates, patches, and features before they're released on the live servers. It's a separate environment where players can get a sneak peek at what's coming next in Valorant. It's also a place where players can help Riot Games by providing feedback and reporting bugs.

## How to Access the Valorant PBE

To access the PBE, you'll need a PBE account. This is separate from your regular Valorant account. Here's how to get one:

1.  **Check Your Eligibility**: Not everyone can join the PBE. Riot Games has set eligibility requirements to ensure that the PBE is used for its intended purpose - testing. You must have a Valorant account in good standing, which means you haven't been banned for negative behavior.
2.  **Sign-Up**: If you meet the eligibility requirements, you can [sign-up for the PBE](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/pbe/) on the Riot Games website. You'll need to log in with your regular Riot account and fill out a PBE sign-up form.
3.  **Wait for Confirmation**: After you've signed up, you'll need to wait for Riot Games to review your application. If you're accepted, you'll receive an email confirming that your application has been received and you'll be able to access the PBE.
4.  **Download the PBE Client**: Once you've been accepted, you'll need to download the PBE client. This is a separate client from the regular Valorant game. You'll need to download and install it to access the PBE.

Remember, your PBE account is separate from your live Valorant account. You'll need to maintain both accounts and ensure that you conduct yourself appropriately on both. If you're banned on the PBE, it doesn't affect your live account, but it does mean you'll lose access to the PBE.

## What Can You Do in the Valorant PBE?

In the Valorant PBE, you can test new features, updates, and patches before they're released on the live servers. This includes new agents, maps, and gameplay changes. You can also provide feedback to Riot Games and report any bugs you find. This helps Riot Games improve the game and provide a better experience for all players.

Remember, the PBE is for testing purposes. The changes you see in the PBE may not be final and could change before they're released on the live servers. Also, not all features available on the live servers may be available in the PBE.

## How Often is the Valorant PBE Updated?

The Valorant PBE is updated regularly, usually every other weekend. This means that you'll have the opportunity to test new features and changes every other weekend. However, the PBE is only open for testing for one weekend per patch. This means that you'll have a limited time to test each update before it goes live on the live servers.

## How to Provide Feedback and Report Bugs

If you find any bugs or have any feedback about the new features or changes, you can report them to Riot Games. Riot Games is particularly interested in bug reports and feedback about the new content. You can provide your feedback and report bugs through the [Valorant PBE subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ValorantPBE/). Riot Games is also accepting bug reports in English.

Please remember to comment on the relevant thread instead of creating a new one. This helps keep the subreddit organized and makes it easier for Riot Games to find and review your feedback and bug reports.

## Conclusion

The Valorant PBE is a great opportunity for players to get a sneak peek at new features and changes, provide feedback, and help improve the game. However, it's important to remember that the PBE is a test server and not all features may be available or final. So, if you're excited to see what's new in Valorant, sign up for the PBE and join the testing!

Remember, the PBE is free to join, but you must meet the eligibility requirements and follow the rules. So, if you're interested in joining the PBE, check your eligibility, sign up, and wait for your invitation to log in.
