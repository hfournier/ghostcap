[ARK: Survival Evolved](https://www.ghostcap.com/gaming/ark/), the award-winning survival game, has captivated millions with its brutal yet enthralling gameplay. One of its standout features is the ability to switch between first and third-person perspectives, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in the prehistoric world.

This article will provide a comprehensive guide on how to utilize the third person view in ARK: Survival Evolved across all platforms, including PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and even on your mobile devices.

## Why Play in Third Person View?

Before we delve into the technicalities, it's important to understand why many players choose to utilize the third person view in ARK. Here are some reasons:

*   **Enhanced Field of Vision:** Third-person view provides a wider angle of view, allowing players to see more of their surroundings. This can be crucial when scouting for threats or navigating tricky terrain.
*   **Character Customization Appreciation:** ARK offers extensive character customization options. Playing in third person lets players appreciate their unique characters while surviving the harsh landscapes.
*   **Improved Combat Strategy:** In third-person view, you can see incoming attacks better, making it easier to plan defensive or offensive strategies.

## Activating Third Person View: A Step-by-Step Guide

### On PC

For PC players, switching to the third person view in ARK is as simple as pressing a key. Here's how:

1.  Begin the game in either single-player mode or an unofficial server that allows third-person perspective.
2.  Once in the game, simply press the 'Scroll Wheel' or 'K' key to toggle the third person view.

Note: Official servers typically default to first-person perspective to maintain a level playing field. However, some unofficial servers do allow third-person view. [Here is a list of such servers](https://arkservers.net/).

### On PlayStation

Switching to third-person view on the PlayStation version of ARK requires a few more steps:

1.  Begin the game in either single-player mode or an unofficial server that permits the third-person view.
2.  Once in the game, press the 'Touchpad' on your controller to open the admin command console.
3.  Type in the following command: `cheat SetCameraPlayerDistance 300` and hit enter.
4.  Close the admin console by pressing the 'Touchpad' again.

### On Xbox

The process for Xbox is similar to that of the PlayStation:

1.  Start the game in single-player mode or an unofficial server that allows third-person view.
2.  Once in the game, press the 'Menu' button on your controller to open the admin command console.
3.  Type in the following command: `cheat SetCameraPlayerDistance 300` and press enter.
4.  Close the admin console by pressing the 'Menu' button again.

### On Mobile Devices

In ARK: Survival Evolved mobile version, the third-person perspective is slightly different. It's known as "Orbit Camera" and can be activated as follows:

1.  Start the game and open the 'Settings' menu.
2.  Under the 'Camera' settings, enable the 'Orbit Camera.'
3.  Close the settings, and you're ready to play in third person.

## Tips and Tricks for Third Person View

Now that you've unlocked the third person view, here are a few tips and tricks to enhance your ARK experience:

*   **Adjust Your Camera Distance:** You can adjust the distance of the camera in third person view by using the command `SetCameraPlayerDistance X`, where X is the desired distance. Experiment with different values to find the one that suits your playstyle best.
*   **Utilize the Orbit Camera:** The Orbit Cameraallows you to rotate the view around your character. This can be particularly helpful when you're building structures or navigating through dense forests.
*   **Practice Combat:** Fighting in third person can feel different compared to the first person view. Take some time to practice and get used to the altered perspective.

## The Impact of ARK's Third Person View on Gameplay

The ability to switch between first and third-person perspectives is more than just a visual gimmick. It profoundly impacts the gameplay experience in ARK.

In first-person view, the game feels more immersive, as if you're really living and breathing in this dangerous world. It can make combat more intense, as your field of vision is limited to what's directly in front of you.

In contrast, third-person view offers a wider field of vision, enabling players to see threats approaching from the sides. It also makes exploration more enjoyable, as you can take in more of the game's stunning environments. However, it can make some players feel slightly detached from the action.

Ultimately, the choice between first and third-person view is a matter of personal preference. ARK: Survival Evolved offers the flexibility to switch between both according to the situation or your mood, and that's part of what makes the game so unique and enjoyable.

## Conclusion

Whether you're a seasoned ARK veteran or a newcomer to the game, playing in third person view can bring a fresh perspective to your gameplay. It's not just about seeing your character's cool armor or the giant dinosaur you're riding. It's about having a different experience, seeing the world of ARK from a new angle, and using this to your advantage.

Remember, the third-person perspective can be a game-changer, but it's up to you to make the most of it. So, jump into the world of ARK: Survival Evolved, and start exploring!
