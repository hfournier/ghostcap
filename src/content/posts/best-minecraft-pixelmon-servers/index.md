Pixelmon Servers have taken the Minecraft modding community by storm since it launched over eight years ago. If anything, its popularity is partly fuelled by the love of Pokemon and similar genre games.

Even though the main branch for the mod was shut down some time back mainly owing to copyright claims made by Nintendo, there are still many servers that host the Pixelmon mod; thus, it's hard not to find Pixelmon Servers.

Though admittedly, some servers are better than others for various reasons. If you're looking to start playing Pixelmon, here is our choice of the best servers.

## Mox MC

IP Address: Moxmc.net

Mox MC is amongst the best Pixelmon servers out there, and that's why it is on our list. The server welcomes many new players each day, and they are welcomed with a new Pokemon. Yes, you get a freebie for joining.

A big part of this server is trading and battles. Mox MC hosts various battles every week, assuring the best performers make it up the ranking ladder. The best will compete with the best to win prices and rare Pokemons.

## Pixelmon Realms

IP Address: play.pixelmonrealms.com

It is one of the more popular Minecraft Pixelmon Servers, but it runs on reforged.

It is one of the most fun Pixelmon Servers we have had the chance of playing on. There is a free rank, pokeheal, and backpack for all players joining the server. Gameplay has players explore various regions that are inspired by many other Pokemon games like Kanto and Johto.

The server also allows players to go on hunts, collect a set of daily rewards and explore the safari zone. Plus, regular events can be immensely helpful in collecting rewards.

## CyborgMC

The server is best known for having players play on a replicated map of our earth's landscape. Here the goal is to catch pokemon and then battle them against other players with the hopes of winning.

The cool thing about the server is that the Pokemon logically spawn in various parts of the world. Take Charizard, for instance, which is known to span near various volcanic areas; the ice pokemon, Abomnasnow will spawn on the North and the South Pole.
