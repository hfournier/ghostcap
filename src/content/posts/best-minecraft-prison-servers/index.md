There's something here for everyone.

So get ready - it's time to lock some people up!

Let's get into our list of the best Minecraft prison servers.

## 5 Best Prison Minecraft Prison Servers:

Our ranking criteria can include the server type, the number of players allowed, the player diversity, and the type of setup in place, among other factors that can be investigated and compared.

So, when you search for the best Minecraft prison servers, you will come across servers which will generally have players from all around the world, and you will have to pick any one of them based on your preferences.

### 1\. PURPLE PRISON

![PURPLE-PRISON-minecraft-roleplay-server](@assets/images/posts/best-minecraft-prison-servers/PURPLE-PRISON-minecraft-roleplay-server.png)

Let's start with the best Minecraft prison server out there, Purple Prison.

This Minecraft server is very different from the others and is located in a place called Republic City. Here, you will come across a virtual prison which is divided into two main sections and offers a lot of things that most other servers simply do not have. The first thing that makes the Purple Prison stand apart from the others is the way it is designed to work.

PURPLE PRISON is based on the prison design itself, which is in this case, a Purple Prison. The two different sections of this prison are based on two different sides of the world of Prison, something which is definitely not found on most prison servers.

*   Designed to work around the prison design
*   Offers a more complex and detailed world
*   Prison-themed server that is different from all others

Next, this server allows players to play anywhere inside the world and interact with other players and NPC's. Since there is no set place like other servers, and a jail cell is not the only place where you can play, the Purple Prison offers a lot of freedom to players who wish to interact with others freely.

This also means that the server's player base is much bigger than other servers. You can always connect using the latest Minecraft version too.

The second Minecraft server on this list is Minecraft Central, which offers a lot of unique settings. To begin with, the Minecraft Central prison server is located in the center of the whole Minecraft world and can be accessed simply by typing in the single command which can take you there.

So, without the need to spend a lot of time moving around the physical world of Minecraft, you are able to reach anywhere in the game directly. The players on Minecraft Central, also receive a very important benefit that the players on other servers do not have.

*   Unique settings to play on that can be reached by a single command
*   Fun time by yourself or with friends
*   Prison server that caters to all your needs

This benefit is something that you find in the real world, and that is the benefit of being the admin. This allows you to staff the prison with guards and other roles that you can assign to players on the basis of their skills. Or the players can choose roles for themselves, but that freedom is only available on Minecraft Central.

## What Is A Minecraft Prison Server?

The main aim of prison servers is to torture players in one way or another, mostly by trying to make them spend the longest possible time in the prison from the time they join. To do that, you can create as many jail cells as you wish, and assign them to people who have committed an offense against you.

Each of the cells can be designed in a specific manner, so that the inmates can be able to suffer or enjoy the experience, depending on your imagination. You can also make the prisoners do a lot of work by assigning certain tasks to them.

These tasks can be crafted works that players can commit to carrying out as punishments for a specific crime they might have committed, or you can just force them to craft good items that you can use later on.

Not only can you manage these prison activities, but you can also make sure that the prisoners who break the prison rules pay the price for it by giving out punishments, which you can choose for yourself, to the inmates. You can also craft houses outside the prison where you may place items that can allow you a greater advantage over other players, such as guns, or traps.

This can be used to give you an advantage over others, who may have broken the rules and must serve the specified punishment, should they disobey the prison rules.

Prison servers are generally a part of Minecraft server networks, and their server's player base is increasing day by day. Playing a Minecraft prison allows you to create, and run, your own prison and manage it, while each player is in charge of carrying out the prison rules and punishing the inmates if they break the rules or get out of line. While Minecraft Prison Servers do have strict rules, it also allows for role-playing.

For some people, prison servers are just the thing when it comes to bringing the jail-like theme to real life. And now that they are becoming so popular, people are being given more and more of an opportunity to create their own prison and put together their own set of rules for the prisoners.

And that is what makes this Minecraft server mode so much fun, because people can be their own prison managers, and may even get to be the guards.

## Wrapping It Up:

So, these were some of the best Minecraft prison servers which you could try out. Now, you know where to go to have fun or simply connect with other players. But the real fun begins when you go into the virtual world of Minecraft and play on the servers.

So, start thinking about a great prison you wish to build and improve your skills in playing Minecraft prison servers.
