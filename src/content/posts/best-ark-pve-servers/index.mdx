## What is ARK PvE?

<Image decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" alt="TODO: update alt text" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" src={__What_is_ARK_PvE_jpg} widths={[1920, 768, 1536]} />

ARK PvE, or Player versus Environment, is a game mode in ARK Genesis designed for players to learn the basics and become familiar with the game. It is ideal for newcomers, as it allows them to understand how to use various weapons, tame creatures, and build structures. In this mode, players can experience ARK in real-time without the risk of losing their progress.

In ARK PvE, other players cannot attack your character, allowing you to focus on building your base and exploring the environment without interference. This mode enables players to construct impressive structures, tame and train a variety of dinosaurs, and even breed unique creatures such as a mutated pteranodon.

While ARK PvE offers numerous advantages, there are some limitations, such as being unable to pick up dinosaurs with flying creatures. This mode is recommended for learning about the game and becoming familiar with its mechanics before advancing to the more challenging pro version.

On the other hand, ARK PvP (Player versus Player) is designed for experienced players. This mode presents a range of challenges, including wild dinosaurs, fall damage, hunger, dehydration, and drowning, making the game more exciting and engaging. By starting with PvE mode, players can learn how to overcome these challenges and be better prepared for the demands of PvP gameplay.
