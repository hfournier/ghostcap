Running one of the biggest Counter Strike community servers in the world, I've had the opportunity to test lots of different server providers. I've also helped thousands of other people on [my Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@GhostCapGaming) and [Discord](https://www.ghostcap.com/discord) help get their game servers' setup correctly. In this post, I'll go over the best CS2 server hosts you can go with today. I've kept it short and simple for you as anyone on this list is suitable for a basic 10 man private server (so pick who has the location near you), but if you need hosts with specialty features for plugins etc, then I've also got them listed too.

## Best CS2 Server Host Roundup

If you don‚Äôt have time to go through the entire list, I‚Äôve listed these 2 first is because their specialty is Counter Strike 2 servers, so they both have features specific to the game.

1.  [Game Host Bros](https://www.gamehostbros.com/cs2-server-hosting/) (That I own): Best support for modding with lots of automation
2.  [DatHost](https://www.ghostcap.com/get/dathost): Lots of locations with an easy-to-use interface

I built [Game Host Bros](https://www.gamehostbros.com/) with Counter Strike 2 in mind. As I run my own servers, I wanted something that was easy to use, while not taking over too much of the game and giving you all the control for installing mods with our automated mod installer/updater. Plus, you get access to me and my knowledge of running a 64 player CS2 server to directly to help with any questions you have. The downside is we don‚Äôt have many locations (yet!).

[DatHost](https://www.ghostcap.com/get/dathost) is another great option for CS2 servers with lots of server locations, a great network and their easy-to-use control panel. However, I found when using them, to install custom mods was cumbersome. Although they also have a mod installer, they are perfect if you want to use a vanilla server and don‚Äôt want to customize it extensively.

## Conclusion

If you're just after a normal Counter Strike 2 server with no mods and just the basic maps, then any provider on this list would do the job for you. Just pick someone with a location near you and your players.

However, if you need specialty features catered towards CS2, then here are your two options.

1.  [Game Host Bros](https://www.gamehostbros.com/) (That I own): Best support for modding with lots of automation
2.  [DatHost](https://www.ghostcap.com/get/dathost): Lots of locations with an easy-to-use interface

If you're looking to host multiple servers then you might want to look into getting a [dedicated server](https://www.ghostcap.com/best-dedicated-game-servers/) as this gives you more control over your game servers, but I would only really suggest doing this if you already have some kind of community already as it can start getting expensive fast.
