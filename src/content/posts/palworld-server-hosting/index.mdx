Whether you're a solo player, a group of friends, or a large community, choosing the right Palworld server hosting provider is crucial for an enjoyable gaming experience. Consider factors such as performance, reliability, configuration options, customer support, and pricing when making your decision. Each provider has its unique strengths and weaknesses, so weigh them carefully to find the best fit for your needs.

If you're just starting, we recommend going with at least 16 GB of RAM to ensure a smooth multiplayer experience. This is the most crucial aspect of hosting your server as Palworld uses more RAM than most other games. Most Palworld server hosting providers offer customizable resources like RAM, CPU, and SSD storage to cater to different player counts and mod preferences.

Setting up a Palworld server is relatively straightforward with most providers. Simply choose your desired plan, preferably one that offers a dedicated server optimized for Palworld, and follow the provided tutorial or seek assistance from the customer support team.

Once your server is set up, you can share the IP address and port with your friends, enabling them to join and play Palworld together. [Here is a guide](https://guides.gamehostbros.com/games/palworld/connect-to-your-server/) you can use on how you can connect to a Palworld server. The guide is specifically for Game Host Bros, but it's the same for every host.

Remember, if you get stuck, you can always join the [GhostCap Discord](https://www.ghostcap.com/discord) to ask questions but don't hesitate to seek support from your provider if you encounter any issues or need assistance with server setup, modding, or configuration.
