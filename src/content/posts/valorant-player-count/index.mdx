**According to Riot Games, the developer of Valorant, the game averages 15.7 million monthly active players.**

Considering that the game is relatively new and is up against some stiff competition, this is an impressive monthly player count.

When it comes to the first-person shooter genre, there are a few that stand out above the rest.

Counter-Strike Global Offensive and Call of Duty are two of the most popular titles in the genre, but a new challenger has emerged in recent years.

Valorant is a free-to-play fps game that has quickly gained a following among gamers.

Many gamers love to see the live player count for the games they are playing. It provides a sense of competitiveness and community, especially between fans of games (Counter Strike Global Offensive vs Valo [for example lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/vdfjt3/regarding_player_count_vs_cs_go/))

For some games, the live player count or how many players are online is available right on the main screen. But for others, like Valorant, it can be difficult to find this information.

Unlike other games, Riot Games doesn't offer the data for live player counts, so anything you see online that pertains to a Valorant live player count is false data. The best we can do is look at the monthly player counts.

This data shows that Valorant has been steadily growing in popularity since its release in 2020.

With over 15 million players worldwide, it is clear that this fps game is here to stay.

So even though we can't get a live count for people playing Valorant, we can still take comfort in knowing that it is one of the most popular fps shooters around.

## Is The Valorant Player Count Increasing?

Since its release in 2020, the Valorant player count has actually started to decline. However, once Riot Games released the [Valorant 4.0 patch](https://playvalorant.com/), this fixed lots of issues new players were facing when starting competitive Valo.

Since these changes in January 2022, Valorant has gained over 1.2 million more monthly active players.

This is a huge increase in just a short amount of time, and it appears that Riot's changes have had a positive effect on the game's player base.

It will be interesting to see if this trend continues in the months to come, but for now, it seems like Valorant is back on track and growing strong.
