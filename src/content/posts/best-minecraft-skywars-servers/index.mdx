It has to be said that Skywars is currently one of the longest-running [PvP](https://www.ghostcap.com/best-minecraft-pvp-servers/) [minigames](https://www.ghostcap.com/best-minecraft-minigames-servers/) in Minecraft. It is where individuals or teams are often battling it out for supremacy.

Minecraft has to be at least one of the most successful games of all time, and it has been here for over a decade with tweaks and improvements making it better each year. However, gamers have been playing Skywars for the majority of the time. It is a competitive PvP game enabling players to join teams to fight solo on vast islands in the sky.

You need to battle using armor, materials, and weapons scattered across large hubs, which requires having a plan and working quickly. One of the keys to success is being geared up, which increases your chances of winning, but it is something all other players will be doing too.

Now, if you are interested in playing Skywars, you need to team up with players who are interested, obviously. The best place to find and play with everyone else is via Minecraft servers that offer this game along with many others across multiple genres. In this article, we will go over the best servers to play Skywards.

Yes, there are a few other servers, but in our experience, they are amongst the best.

## 5 Best Minecraft Skywars Servers

### Hypixel

IP: mc.hypixel.net

Anyone who has been playing Minecraft for a while has at least heard about the Hypixel server. It is amongst the most popular Minecraft servers, and over the years, it has become a sort of a trailblazer for the community. The server has many games, with Skywars being one that players can log in to enjoy with a growing community of players.

If you are looking for a Minecraft server with a long history and a dedicated player base, then Hypixel is for you.

### Herobrine

IP: Herobrine.org

It is another excellent choice for players who want to start playing Skywars or even more seasoned players who haven’t played on this server before. It is also home to other minigames. In addition to playing Skywars, you can also play [Bedwars](https://www.ghostcap.com/best-minecraft-bedwars-servers/), Factions, Earth [Towny](https://www.ghostcap.com/best-minecraft-towny-servers/), survival, etc.  
In case you were wondering, the name “Herobrine” does not mean anything, but it has been named after one of the longest-running urban legends in the community. You can find a lot of information about this urban legend online.

### Mineplex

IP: us.mineplex.com or pe.mineplex.com

We’d have to say that Mineplex is another excellent Minecraft server for players who want to find others who enjoy playing Skywars. It is a vast server, with lots of things you do. There is painting, FPS games, and a special version of Smash Bros. If you can think of what type of game you want to play, we can quite frankly bet that they have it here. There is a whole survival server and a section dedicated to a laundry list of survival games.

However, we’ve played a few hours of Skywars on it, and we can tell you the experience was exceptional but so was the experience of playing other games. The staff is super responsive, which means that you can get help when you need it.

### Mineland Network

IP: promo.play-ml.ru

Now this server is another community-based name on our list, with highly responsive moderators, a growing and already large player base, along with a leader board. Yes, all the names above you on the leaderboard make it look daunting for first-time players, but we assure you that the effort will be worth it.

The Mineland Network, in addition to offering Skywars, also has a few other [minigames](https://www.ghostcap.com/best-minecraft-minigames-servers/), each one of which is equally popular. So, while this article is about playing Skywards, there is no harm in trying a few other minigames, too, while you are at it.

### Extreme Craft

IP: play.extremecraft.net

Now it would be impossible to list the best Skywars Minecraft servers without a mention of Extreme Craft. It is without a doubt one of the most popular ones out there.

However, the server is home to many Skywars players and the sheer number of modes that you can play. You can play hunger games, survival mode, skygrid, skyblock, egg wars, factions, etc. Plus, you’ve also got a creative mode, and then there is roleplaying. Think of it as being a sort of greatest hits of Minecraft minigames.

### Skyblock

IP: skywars.com

So, Skyblock is amongst one of the best Skywars servers, in our opinion, mainly because it also has “sky” in the name. However, that “sky” in its name is not only because you can play Skywars but because the server has Skyblocks, a similar minigame, but the goal here is for players to survive with the materials provided while completing various challenges.

However, Skywars is a more PvP centric minigame and tends to have a large number of players online at any given time. Our suggestion is to try Skyblocks while you are at it.

### CubeCraft Games

The large size of the CubeCraft makes this the best server for playing Minecraft minigames because there are loads of other players to join in Skywars matches. Games are being played at all times, with the servers running full blast 24 hours a day and 7-days a week. Understandably weekends are the busiest, but that does not slow the server down one bit.

Furthermore, you are treated to an active and growing discord community, and there are Skywars forums for the server. The forums and community help players remain updated on the latest developments and communicate about server issues experienced.

## Conclusion

Today, there are loads of Minecraft servers to choose from, with some being larger than others. However, as we just saw, many servers offer Skywars as one of the games on their list. That’s probably an incentive to try other minigames and various modes to get the most out of your experience. Hopefully, this list saves you from the frustration of having to play on a slow, outdated, and often unmanaged server.
