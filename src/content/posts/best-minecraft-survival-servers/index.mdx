What's your favorite part about Minecraft?

The building blocks, the animals, or the mobs that want to kill you?

If you're like me then it's either all of them or none of them.

I love this game but if I'm being honest with myself there are some parts that really do not appeal to me.

One thing, in particular, is a survival mode where players have to mine for resources and fight off monsters while trying to stay alive as long as possible.

Now a lot of people might be thinking "so what?"

Well "so what" is actually why I think you should try out one of these best Minecraft Survival Servers instead!

## 5 Best Minecraft Survival Servers

Playing Minecraft alone can get boring, but with a survival server, you have the opportunity to work together or go it solo while building your own home and defending yourself against zombies.

Wonder how this game could be more fun? Well here are some of the best Minecraft servers that make playing even better!

Here is the GhostCap Gaming list of the best Minecraft survival servers.

### 1\. MineSuperior

![MineSuperior-Server-Screenshot](MineSuperior-Server-Screenshot-1.png)

MineSuperior is part of the next generation of Minecraft server setups. Designed to be for players, always constantly adding new ideas, designed to be transparent and accessible by all!

MineSuperior features Factions with Skyblock and Survival modes.

It also has Towny which enables you to create your own town or city where other users can visit if they want a change in scenery from their current spawn point, Prison (if that's what interests you), Creative mode so everyone can have fun creating whatever it is they're interested in building- even KitPVP where every player gets a kit at random before going into battle against each other!

MineSuperior actually has 3 different survival servers you can choose from, Emerald, Diamond, and Gold. I was however not able to find what the difference in these servers is.

**Each survival server includes:**

- Claims
- Economy
- Jobs
- Quests
- Achievements
- Player warps

MineSuperior tops our list because it's made by gamers, for gamers. It's not made by people who are simply trying to make money. Our only suggestion for improvement is to their website. It was very hard to find the MineSuperior IP address and port and we had to go to a 3rd party site.

Luckily, we have included the details for you below.

Mineville (formerly InPVP) has the highest player count for Bedrock in history, 27,123 as of 2019

MineVille is also a roleplaying server but lets you play minigames at their "space station" lobby if you want to switch things up.

Owned by MobCrush, an entertainment company best known for its streaming app on mobile devices, Mineville offers two sister servers on other platforms like SaicoPvP or The Legend Craft--a popular Italian Server!

This tutorial feature is what earned Complex Gaming a spot on our list for the best Minecraft Survival servers!

## What Is Minecraft Survival?

Minecraft Survival mode is the classic way of playing Minecraft, and one of the coolest ways to play.

In Minecraft survival, you start off with nothing but your 2 bare hands, and you have to take resources from the environment (such as trees, rocks, etc), craft them into tools (and weapons!), then use those tools for various purposes.

You then need to defend yourself against the hostile mobs (creeps, spiders, and zombies), find food, make a shelter to protect you from the monsters at night.

On Minecraft survival servers, you can either play alone or with others people, of any group size too!

- Build, explore and fight your way across a variety of small, medium or large scale maps
- Form alliances with other players to be safe during the night
- Make friends from all over the world

## Tips for playing Minecraft Survival mode

The best base you can build to **start off in Minecraft is a 4x4 or Cliffside base**. What this does is give you a lot of space to work with and isn't too difficult to build, either!

As for tools, it's best to get a **full set of stone tools before iron.**

What this does is make sure you have access to all the tools in Minecraft if for some reason your iron gets destroyed or lost.

**I build my starter bases like this:**

<Image
  decoding="async"
  width="1920"
  height="1080"
  alt="Minecraft Starter Survival Base"
  sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"
  src={__Minecraft_Starter_Survival_Base_png}
  widths={[1920, 768, 1536]}
/>

- A workbench where I can craft stone tools and blocks.
- Enough room to store my items, such as a chest or two chests with the crafting table on one side of them. What this does is keep me from losing everything while working on something else!
- Storage for food so that if I need to eat

I would normally **build on a plain biome where I can see everything**. What this does is provide a lot of space to work with and not have it be too difficult.

**Later on,** **the base would look like this:**

<Image
  decoding="async"
  width="1920"
  height="1080"
  alt="Minecraft Survival Base Finished"
  sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"
  src={__Minecraft_Survival_Base_Finished_png}
  widths={[1920, 768, 1536]}
/>

This makes it harder for creeps to come in when its night time. It also is WAY cheaper to create as you are not building walls or a roof.
