Agrarian Skies is one of the most popular Minecraft modes, and one of the reasons people join a server is to play with possibly dozens of others who enjoy the mode.

The game is multiplayer, but some severs can have more players than others. During our research, we also came across servers with as few as 8 players online, which is why they didn’t make the cut.

In a nutshell, for those who don’t know, this is a modded version of Minecraft, which has the Skyblock Survival map, and players need to move through various adventures. The world is a small island but with various challenges and plots.

## 4 Best Minecraft Agrarian Skies Servers

The best way to play Agrarian Skies is with others online, and here are the top 5 places to do it.

### APOC Gaming Modpack Network

APOC Gaming is one of the largest, multi-server vanilla and modded networks, The network hosts multiple servers supporting Minecraft 1.5.2, 1.16, and various others. However, all the servers are independently hosted.

The good thing about their Agrarian Skies server is that it always has players online, which means regardless of your time zone or when you want to play, the server is available, and so are players.

### RocknoMc

The RocknoMc is mainly an Indian Minecraft server, but like all other servers, anyone can join. The good thing about the RocknoMc server is that there is a lot to do here. You can play Survival, Bedwars, and Minigames.

In addition, the server has support for Minecraft version 1.8 and beyond. In our experience, it is one of the best servers for Agrarian Skies because of the number of people online at the same time.

So, not only are there people from India but across the world, which is what makes it fun to play on it.

### FinalCraft SkyHorizon

FinalCraft SkyHorizon is a Brazilian Minecraft sever, but just about anyone is welcome to join. While we did experience some sluggish performance after connecting to the server, it gradually improved.

We aren’t saying that the server is slow, but it could be because there were more people on the server than it could handle.

Even then, we think it is an excellent server for anyone who wants to play Agrarian Skies.

Mineaurion FTB Agrarian Skies is considered the best server by Agrarian Skies players. In our experience, the majority of people who encountered the server said they loved it. The good thing is that there aren’t any restrictions on the use of a mod pack.

The other good thing is that there is no lag with it running at 20TPS. In addition, there are a couple of protection systems in place to ensure that everything is safe.

We spoke to some members of the community, and everything seems to be awesome, which is why we can openly recommend it.
