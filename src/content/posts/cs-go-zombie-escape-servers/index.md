So what's the best CS GO Zombie Escape server? Well, the answer is a bit tricky. It really depends on what you're looking for - there are servers that cater to serious gamers who want an intense Zombie Escape experience and others that are more fun-oriented.

*   If you are playing as a zombie your goal is to knife all the humans until no humans alive

*   Don't ever micspam or spam in the chat that can ruin the gameplay of ZE

While in a normal CS GO server, players need to take up the role of either the Counter-Terrorists or Terrorists to fight against each other, the game Zombie Escape is far different from what you know. In these servers, players have to either fight against zombies or protect each other from being attacked by them.

When the server starts, everyone is human and then one zombie is created. They are then teleported back to spawn. From there, the humans must survive from the attacks of the zombies as long as they can while they gather the objects and try kill the zombies.

But their survival mode is only over when the zombies in the server manage to kill all of them, or they escape the map. Since the zombies have the advantage of attacking with an insane amount of health, players have to stick with their partners for the greater good.

Almost all the Zombie Servers played at CS GO are in the third-person mode, although this is up to you if you want to play it like that.

## What Is Zombie Escape?

As the name suggests, you'll have to escape from zombies. These zombies are a randomly selected number of players (regardless of the class) at the beginning of the map after a short delay of (usually) 12 seconds. Zombies become Terrorists and all other players become Counter-Terrorists.

From here on, the zombies/Terrorists will have all their weapons stripped but the knife and eventually being teleported back to spawn. The objective for the Counter-Terrorists is to prevent themselves from being 'zombified'.

The objective for the zombies/Terrorists is to 'zombify' the Counter-Terrorists to spread out their horde and cause the extinction of the humans.

In Zombie CS GO servers, human players are pitted against an army of bloodthirsty zombies, and are tasked with finishing a map before the Zombies infect them all.

However, even if players have the boldest intentions, you can't play it alone, but have to do it in groups. Also despite being a game that plays on the hero-versus-monster theme, Zombie CS GO servers are not always about shooting the zombies and slaying them. Instead, they also give a lot of importance to puzzle-like situations, for example how to survive, how to defend, and how to complete the tasks in the single or the allotted time frame.

Zombie Escape servers are amongst the most popular CS GO servers available in the online gaming world and with these new entries, players are now able to battle the undead. To make things more interesting, these Zombie Escape servers provide players with a whole new set of rules and regulations, as well as new maps where the craziest of players can indulge in the most gruesome of killstrikes.

While there are free zombie servers running all the time with numerous maps, players looking for an ultimate experience can look for private zombie servers.

In recent years, a number of different games have emerged in the video game world that allow you to play on the edge of your seat. But when it comes to full-fledged entertainment, no game comes close to Counter Strike.

One of the most played games, CS GO, has become a global phenomenon in the gaming community. And the fact that the number of gamers addicted to this game has crossed the 20 million mark is no small achievement to be ignored or negated.

But along with the fun and games that gamers have experienced in this game, CS GO has also offered them a different kind of fun, and a unique type of adventure via modded servers. One of these modded game modes happens to be Zombie Escape servers that have become a massive hit among the gaming community.
