With a limited number of options, this mode brings forth challenges that you might not expect at all. It also has a unique set of prerequisites. In this mode, you cannot use any other kinds of blocks (except the ones from the pre-selected list).

This means you cannot use any modified blocks, and neither, the ones that you might be depending on for your creative gameplay. This mode is slightly more flexible, but still limiting and loads of fun!

You may think that this mode is for noobs, but that really is not the case! If you want to be completely free, there is no other mode that allows you to be as creative as you want.

This video game was developed by Swedish gamer Markus Persson, and because of its popularity, been bought by Microsoft for 2.5 billion dollars in 2014. With Minecraft, people can dig things, build things, and even design their own worlds.

Some other modes available in this game include being able to explore different worlds, fight the different kinds of monsters included in the game, and even collect the materials for a wide range of things.

But among all of the options available in this game, the one that has become the most popular is the creative mode.
