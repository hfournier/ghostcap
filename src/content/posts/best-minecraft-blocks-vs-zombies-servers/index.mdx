Minecraft is an amazing game, but the servers can be a little bit hit or miss.

You never know what you're going to get when you join a Minecraft server. Sometimes you'll find a great server with lots of people and interesting mods, while other times you'll end up on a server with barely anyone online and no cool mods.

We've collected the best Minecraft blocks vs zombies servers into one easy-to-use list.

## 4 Best Blocks Vs Zombies Servers

We've spent years searching for the perfect Minecraft server to satisfy your zombie needs. We tried out many different types of servers: PVP, a full-on Zombie Apocalypse experience, and more!

AncientTimesMC is a relatively new server, but they seem to be doing some good work.

Compared to all the other Minecraft Blocks Vs Zombie servers we tried, AncientTimesMC has the best support offered by a team that cares about people having a great experience.

*   Survival mode with hostile mobs and a challenging environment
*   Friendly and helpful staff who want you to have a great experience

SharpnessPvP isn’t just a server where you log in to play Minecraft Blocks Vs Zombies, but a passionate player base.

## What Is A Blocks VS Zombies Minecraft Server?

Minecraft Blocks Vs. Zombies is a colorful [minigame](https://www.ghostcap.com/best-minecraft-minigames-servers/) developed by SethBling. It combines survival and a bit of maniacal horror as players go up against waves of zombies advancing on their position. There is a lot on the map, and quite frankly, that is what makes this such a fun game.

Players in Minecraft Blocks Vs Zombies are tasked with holding the endpoint of a trench, with the game gradually filling up with zombies. At first, players start by using their bows to thin out the invading hordes of zombies.

However, you are awarded gold for kill streaks which requires working as a team. As the number of gold and zombies increases, you can upgrade current guns, weapons and erect barriers to delay zombies from getting to you.

Besides having to fight them head-on, players can also set up traps to defend against the undead, often multiple at the same time.

As you’d guess, playing Minecraft Blocks Vs. Zombies is the best with others, and that’s where logging on to a server comes in (or you can create your own).

## Conclusion

Minecraft multiplayer servers come and go all the time, but the game modes stay the same. No matter if you're playing Factions, PVP, or minigames, it's always good to seek new servers with different players.
