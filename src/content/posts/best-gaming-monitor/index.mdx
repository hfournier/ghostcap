## What To Look For When Buying A Gaming Monitor

### Screen size

A good-sized monitor will help you capture all the details in a game. Wider screens are better for strategy games.

### Budget

Not all gaming computers come under $1,000. There are extremely expensive pieces and cheaper ones too. Since all will come with a fair balance of pros and cons, it is up to you to choose according to your budget.

### GPU

The GPU is important in fast-paced games. Look for compatibility with AMD or Nvidia graphics card. A great GPU will display information-rich games with no lagging.  
Refresh rate. Just like GPU, fast-paced games will require a higher refresh rate, measured in Hz.

## Why Do You Need A Gaming Monitor

Even with the best gaming laptop, the full experience is still not achieved if you don’t own a gaming monitor. They are essential because they help you free up your laptop screen for other uses like chats or guides. With a larger display, offline multiplayer games are more enjoyable.
