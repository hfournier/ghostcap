In this guide, we're going to show you exactly how you can install mods onto Palworld. To do this, we will install UE4SS, a popular framework that allows you to install mods from places like Nexus Mods.

This will cover both setting up UE4SS on your game client, and your server, as some mods are required to be installed on both. The method is the same.

## Installing UE4SS on Palworld

This is how you can install Palworld locally on your PC. This is required before you install any mods on your Palworld server.

1.  Download the latest UE4SS release from [here](https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases). The file will be called something like **ue4ss\_v3.0.1.zip.**
2.  Now open Steam, right-click the game and select **Manage > Browse local files**.
3.  Navigate to `\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Palworld\Pal\Binaries\Win64`
4.  Unzip the downloaded UE4SS zip to this directory.
5.  Launch Palworld

## Installing Mods on Palworld

Now that UE4SS is installed, it's time to install your first mods. You can get mods from sites such as [Nexus mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/). 

1.  Download the Palworld mod you want from Nexus Mods
2.  Now open Steam, right-click the game and select **Manage > Browse local files**.
3.  Navigate to `\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Palworld\Pal\Binaries\Win64`
4.  Unzip the downloaded plugin zip to this directory.

Some mods may require different locations, so please make sure you read the instructions for each Palworld mod you install.

## Troubleshooting

*   Sometimes the latest UE4SS version on GitHub doesn't work, and you need the latest dev version. There is no easy way to get this, and it's best to search for the latest link in the Palworld Discord.
*   Remember that UE4SS only works on Windows, Wine and Proton. If you have a Linux server then you will need to wait for UE4SS to be ported to Linux.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, installing UE4SS on Palworld is a straightforward process that enhances your gaming experience by enabling modding capabilities. Remember, for the latest updates and versions, especially if the current release doesn't work, checking the Palworld Discord is highly recommended. With UE4SS, the modding possibilities for Palworld are vast and exciting, offering a new dimension to your gameplay.
