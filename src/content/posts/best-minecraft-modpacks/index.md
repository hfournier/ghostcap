'Modpacks' is simply short for modification packs. The provision of modpacks is the best way to add varieties of features to Minecraft. A modpack is a group of several different modifications created to make your Minecraft game more adventurous, providing great features and upping your gameplay.

There are several modifications that have been made available for you to switch up your game. You might not be able to have all of them and that's why modpacks have been made available. All you have to do is choose which group you want.

## Downloading Minecraft Modpacks

To access and enjoy these varieties of modifications and added features, you have to download them. Ensure you use trusted sources to download them so you don't end up getting viruses or malware. To download them, you can use the official Minecraft forum and known sources such as PlanetMinecraft launcher, CurseForge / Overwolf launcher, Technipack, or Feed The Beast (FTB) launcher.

These launchers make playing modpacks quite easy as you don't have to install them. They are installed automatically when you choose a pack off the list. The installation of the pack is free. Launchers require you to input your real Minecraft name and password on their site. This is safe for Feed The Beast launcher and also Overwolf launcher. Don't be in a hurry to provide your real Minecraft name and password on other unpopular launchers.

Modpacks contain many features which can all be used simultaneously. The pack you pick determines the type of game you play and each modpack is run on a different version from the rest. Every modification is supported by certain versions of Minecraft and the version determines the type of modification included in the pack.

## Best Modpacks Available For Minecraft.

Here are some of the best modpacks available for you.

### Sky Factory 4 (SF4)

This is one of the best and most interesting modpacks you can get on Minecraft. It is about building a factory in the sky. You are provided with a tree and the crust of earth the tree grew from and you are surrounded by a vast emptiness. How are you expected to expand with just that? Well, cutting down the tree is the way to go. The leaves of the felled tree decay and form young trees, increasing the number of trees you have as you do this over time. The expansion of your island leads to the discovery of more very useful resources for you.

### Stone block 2 (SB2)

This modpack is close to the Sky Factory 4, only that your world is filled with stones and you have to mine the stones for resources, unlike in Sky Factory 4 where you get your resources from the tree. It uses the E mod, where you are allowed to trade most items for other items you think would be useful to you. E.g, you can trade 100 stones for 100 EMC. You can also trade EMC for iron or gold. With the EMC, you can trade junk for valuable stuff. This modpack also features Draconic Evolutions, giving you the chance to build energy storage, bows, and power armor to defend yourself and your park against the chaos guardian or chaos chicken, depending on the pack.

### RL Craft Modpack (Real-life-style Minecraft modpack).

It is a great choice for veteran players. This modpack is very challenging as it features dragons flying around in the main world where you can easily be killed. It was the most downloaded modpack in February 2021. If you like challenges, then this modpack is for you.

### Infinity Evolved Modpack

This modpack has many gameplay styles. It is a general all-purpose modpack that has a lot of the common Minecraft modifications. It has 2 modes, the normal mode and the expert mode which is more difficult and makes the game prolonged and challenging. It can be downloaded on the Feed The Beast launcher.

### Valhesia 3

This pack runs on the latest version, bringing to you very current content you will love like Botania, Biomes O'Plenty, and Immersive Engineering. These current contents have replaced some of the older versions like Draconic Evolution, Tinker's Construct, and EnderIO. You can download this modpack on curseforge.

### Regrowth

It comes as a quest, guiding you to the objectives of the pack. You get to grow a world again from a world that has become a wasteland. The progression of this game is slow which brings about the challenges of trying to protect yourself from monsters and a stronger mob. You are not able to gather enough resources or equipment that would help you protect yourself in time. It can be downloaded on the Feed The Beast launcher.

This is a Pokemon-themed Minecraft for lovers of Pokemon. With pixelmon moderation as the main modification in the pack, you also get Biomes O'Plenty, Gameshark, BOP patcher, Pixelmon OST, and Pixel Extras.
