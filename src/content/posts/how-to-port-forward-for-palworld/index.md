You've just set up your Palworld server at home, then you give out your IP address [to your friends](https://www.ghostcap.com/how-to-play-palworld-with-friends/) to join, but then they tell you that they can't connect to the server. The most common issue for this is you have not forwarded your ports.

In this Palworld port forwarding guide, we will show you exactly how you can open the ports on your router.

## How to Port Forward in Palworld

Follow our guide below to forward your ports and set up your Palworld server:

1.  **Log in to your router**: Open your web browser and enter your router's IP address in the address bar. This is usually something like 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1. The address as well as the login can be found on the bottom of your router.
2.  **Find the port forwarding section**: This is often located under "Advanced Settings," "Network," or "NAT." It varies by make and model, so check your router’s manual or online resources.
3.  **Create a new port forwarding rule**: You’ll need to make sure to forward specific ports used by Palworld. Here are the ports you need to forward:
    *   **Internal Port:** 8211
    *   **External Port:** 8211
    *   **Protocol:** TCP/UDP
    *   **IP Address:** The local IP of your home computer running the Palworld server. You can find this in your network settings or by using the `ipconfig` command in Command Prompt.
4.  **Save your settings**: Once you've entered the ports and IP address, save the settings and restart your router.

## How To Test If Your Ports Are Open Externally

Now you will need to check if the ports are actually open. I found the best way of checking if ports are open is by using a tool called [check-host.net](https://check-host.net/).

1.  Type \`whats my ip\` into google and copy the address. This is your external IP.
2.  Paste your IP into the [check-host.net](https://check-host.net/) website and add the port to the end (like this 213.34.124.42:8211)
3.  Click TCP Port and UDP Port in check-host, it should tell you if it's connected.

## Troubleshooting Tips

*   **Double-check the ports**: Ensure you’ve forwarded the correct ports in your router.
*   **Verify your IP address**: Make sure the local IP address is correct.
*   **Restart devices**: Sometimes a simple restart of your router and PC can resolve the issue.
*   **Check you're not on CGNAT:** Lots of ISPs these days use something called CGNAT, this means you're not able to port forward from your house. You would need to google your ISP or call them to find out if you're on CGNAT.

## Why You Need to Forward Ports

Port forwarding is designed to allow incoming network requests to reach your game server. This can help improve your connections, making multiplayer gaming smoother. If you’re using a Palworld dedicated server, port forwarding is essential to ensure other players can connect.

## Conclusion

Setting up port forwarding might seem daunting at first, but it's a necessary step to ensure players can connect to your [Palworld server](https://www.ghostcap.com/palworld-server-hosting/). By following this guide, you can successfully open the required ports on your router, allowing your friends to connect to your server without any issues. If you encounter any problems, remember to check your ports, verify your IP addresses, and consult your ISP if necessary.
