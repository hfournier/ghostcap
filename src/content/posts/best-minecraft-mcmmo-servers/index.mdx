Minecraft mcMMO is an abbreviation for Minecraft Massively Multiplayer Online. It is a Minecraft plugin, that has been around for some time but happens to be arguably the most popular plugin for many server owners, similar to Factions and Skyblock.

The McMMO has made a few small changes to the game to give players a very different experience, like an MMORPG. Server owners can use the plugin to create their own dungeons and quests for players. In addition, there are new skill mechanics which affect how players will experience the world. If you are looking to experience mcMMO, here are the best servers in our experience. 

## MineSuperior

IP: play.minesuperior.com

We have been playing on MineSuperior for quite some time, and they continue adding new features to keep things interesting. In addition to McMMO, they also have Skyblock, Prison, and the famous Creative Minecraft server. If anything, this is the largest server on our list, with many of anti-griefing tools and staff that ensures everyone follows the rules.

## Mineville

IP: server.mineville.org

The Mineville network of servers features Prison, Skyblock, and Survival-type games, along with its focus on McMMO. Over the months we’ve been using this server, we’ve seen its popularity rise steadily, along with a host of new features added almost regularly. Players on the server can compete in parkour, PvP combat, and various other events to level up their skills and build their outpost in the expansive world. As of late, they also added an AmongUs server.

## **InsanityCraft**

IP: hub.insanitycraft.net

This is a considerably large network of servers, including McMMO and faction gameplay, survival, and Skyblock. There are numerous contests almost every day, and players can enter with a chance to win cash prizes. What’s great about the network is that it is operated by experts who have been building and running these servers for years.

## **LemonCloud**

IP: mc.lemoncloud.net

Now, this is another large network, which includes McMMO. The McMMO has a great deal of content to explore, offering claiming and building opportunities to players. The server features survival and creative worlds in addition to Skyblock, Factions, PvP, and Prison. In our experience, there are hundreds of players on this server at any given time, so you can make lots of friends along the way.

## **ExtremeCraft**

IP: play.extremecraft.net

The network of servers offers all the classic game modes like Anarchy, Bedwars, survival, and creative. The good thing about the network is the large community of mostly friendly people, along with a host of exciting worlds. Plus, they are always accepting new players who can come in and carve out a town of their own, maybe.

## **Complex Gaming**

IP: hub.mc-complex.com

Complex Gaming is one of the best servers on our list and includes a healthy mix of both unmodded and modded servers. You’ve got McMMO FTB and Pixelmon, amongst other features and various game types. In addition, there are loads of minigames and worlds to explore and build, making it one of the best servers out there in our experience.
