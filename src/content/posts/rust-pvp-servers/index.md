### 2\. Rustafied

It is among the few Rust PVP servers that are currently running that caters to a lot of players. It is the most populated server among the rest. They offer a high number of players to choose from.

There is no doubt that the Rustafied server has the freedom to roam around, trade with other players, and even build your own village. However, there are people who are against the idea of being a part of a server like this.

*   Plenty of players to choose from
*   Freedom to build and roam around
*   Lack of authority control, do what you want when you want
*   Hostile environment which makes it more realistic on how the world really is

They are saying that the environment is hostile, the Server itself can be seen as an authoritative regime, and that there are a lot of intimidations that occur in the server.

### 3\. AndysolAM

Andysoiam is one of the best PVP servers in the world today. The best part is that it is being developed by a former member of the Facepunch studio. The incredible thing about this server is that it is still growing and in its infant stage.

*   A server backed by a member of the Facepunch studio
*   Still in its infancy so there are ample opportunities for promotion, growth, and expansion
*   Ryan or "Andysoiam" is really easy to get hold of so you won't be ignored
*   The place is simply worth checking out.

It is, however, worth noting that this server still does not have a huge player base. The thing is, once they acquire a player base that will provide them with better services, it will become a great place to be in.
