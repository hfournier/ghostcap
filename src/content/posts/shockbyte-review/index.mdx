Starting from humble beginnings back in March 2013, Shockbyte has paved the way for game server hosting with its experienced team and great hardware [backed by the OVH cloud network](https://www.ovhcloud.com/).

In fact, in an age of "summer hosting companies", Shockbyte has stood the test of time being one of the longest-running Minecraft hosts in the world.

However, since those humble days that they have since grown into [other game hosting services](https://www.ghostcap.com/game-server-hosting/) and expanded their range of hosting offerings to include 32 of the most popular games.

In this Shockbyte review, we will take a deeper dive into the Shockbyte hosting service and see if it's a hosting provider you should spend your hard-earned dollars with.

## Is Shockbyte Hosting Worth It?

In my experience, is Shockbyte worth it, yes. Although I've had experience with their service before, I personally hosted a Minecraft Dirt 1GB plan for $2.50 USD per month for this review.

It's a great and easy to use service with a 4.7-star rating over 7300 reviews. With that said, there has been times in the past they've dropped the ball on support, but from what I see they are working on this. They have an expansive knowledgebase, so most of the questions you have can be answered there.

I would recommend Shockbyte for these game servers:

*   Minecraft Java and Bedrock (The owner has first-hand experience with Minecraft communities)
*   ARK Survival Evolved (It's a good price for the resources)
