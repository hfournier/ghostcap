## What to Look for When looking for the best Gaming Keyboard

When deciding which gaming keyboard to choose, there are three key areas to choose from.

### Keyboard size

By now you’ve already noticed some gaming keyboards with wide frames. That’s because larger keyboards reduce shoulder strain and allow you to key in faster.

### Membrane/Mechanical

Well, this will depend on your liking or feel when using the keyboard. Membrane keyboards have a membrane layer under the keys making them soft when pressed. Mechanical keyboards have a distinct click sound. It is easier to tell if you’ve pressed a key in mechanical keyboards than the membrane types.

### Customization

The best gaming keyboards have the most customization options. That’s because each game you play will have a slightly different set of controls. Some customizations like RGB lighting will also help during gameplay in poorly lit rooms.
