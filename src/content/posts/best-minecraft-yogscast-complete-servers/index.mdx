Over the past few years, the number of people active on the server has doubled, with many of them based in the US, while others are in various parts of Asia and Europe.

### Zekkan MC

Zekkan MC is one of the few Minecraft servers which don’t have many Americans. There are some Europeans, but in our experience, most players are Asian.

Not that it’s a bad thing, but it means they will be playing when you’re working because of the time difference. However, don’t let that put you down; give the server a shot, and join the community.

We found the server very responsive, and that’s one of the keys to enjoying Yogscast servers.

### SharpnessPvP

SharpnessPVP is one of the most established [Minecraft PvP servers](https://www.ghostcap.com/best-minecraft-pvp-servers/) out there. Its players are passionate community members, but the fast servers mean that you’ll be enjoying hours of fun without a hiccup.

The player kits on the server are very balanced; this is on purpose so that everyone playing can become great, regardless of how much time they have spent on it.

In our experience, SharpnessPvP is the best server for anyone who wants to enjoy playing Yogscast.

However, you may have to put up with the initial learning curve, which should be fixed by a few hours of gameplay and interacting with the community’s members.

Speaking of which, the tight-knit community is made of people from across the world, so not everyone speaks English fluently.

This server is a great way to connect and make friends.

Now many people reading this may not be familiar with Yogscast Complete servers. Those that are may probably not be entirely familiar with the backstory.

It is one of the most popular Minecraft series, with its roots dating back to 2010. Back then, Brindley and Lane started their series called Let’s Play, which was a [Minecraft-style survival multiplayer](https://www.ghostcap.com/best-minecraft-survival-servers/) video. As the series progressed, it evolved into a semi-improvised comedy called Shadow of Israphel.

The new series led to a boom in the number of YouTube subscribers, which became a major contributing factor to their road to stardom. The final installment was 41 and was released in 2012.

There was another Brindley and Lane Minecraft series, which involved them playing and often bumbling through various Minecraft player-made maps, which showcased many maps to the community.

Later in 2011, Yogcast curated and then released their collection of mods, referred to as the Yogbox.

## Conclusion

Hopefully, you have found the Yogscast Minecraft server that you want to play on. I personally suggest spending your time on Sharpness as they have an awesome community as well as minimal banned items.
