In the "clone wars RP" game mode for the PC game Garry's Mod, players take on the roles of various characters from the Star Wars universe. These include clone troopers, battle droids, Jedi knights, and more.

The objective of the game is to complete various missions assigned by either the Republic or the Separatists. These missions typically involve fighting off enemy forces or escorting VIPs to safety.

The clone wars RP game mode is one of the most popular in Garry's Mod, thanks to its fast-paced gameplay and detailed graphics. SuperiorServers is perhaps the best place to try this game mode.

Compared to the other servers on this list, this is a more serious server. When you join the server, generally a higher level player will give you a..... Actually, maybe you should join and see what it's all about!

### 3\. Sunrust Zombie Survival

It's the end of the world as we know it, and you're stuck on Sunrust with a bunch of other survivors. The only thing standing between you and gruesome death is your wits and whatever weapons you can find. If you're going to make it off the map alive, you'll need to be smart about how you approach each situation.

Zombies are everywhere, and they're not the only danger you'll face. There are also hostile survivors who will stop at nothing to get what they want. To give yourself the best chance of survival, you'll need to be prepared for anything.

You may have heard of [Zombie Escape for CSGO](https://www.ghostcap.com/cs-go-zombie-escape-servers/), but in Garry's Mod this is called Zombie Survival (ZS for short). When you start, There are 2 teams, Zombies and Survivors. As a survivor, your goal is to defend against the zombie attacks and escape to win the match (hey that sounds like CSGO Zombie Escape!)

The biggest difference is the number of mods you can have on the server and the types of defense you can do.

If you're a fan of Zombie game modes, Sunrust should be added to your favorite servers page today.

### 4\. GarnetGaming DarkRP

<Image decoding="async" width="1280" height="720" alt="TODO: update alt text" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" src={__GarnetGaming_DarkRP_jpg} widths={[1280, 768]} />

By now you have most likely joined a few Garry's Mod servers and spent about 5 years downloading all the custom assets, but what about if you just want to jump in and play with NO downloads (besides a map of course). This is exactly what GarnetGaming DarkRP offers.

The server has a lot of great features, including a custom map, custom jobs, and a friendly community. I've been playing on the server for about a month, and I've had a great time.

The most unique thing about GarnetGaming DarkRP is the custom map.

Most servers use the default Garrys Mod map, which is fine, but it can get boring after a while. GarnetGaming's custom map is much more detailed and interesting, and it really adds to the experience. Another great feature of the server is the custom jobs.

There are over 100 different jobs to choose from, so you're sure to find one that you like. And if you don't like any of the default jobs, you can even create your own!

Finally, the community on GarnetGaming DarkRP is really great. Everyone is friendly and helpful, and it's just generally a fun place to be. If you're looking for a new Garrys Mod server to play on, I highly recommend GarnetGaming DarkRP.
