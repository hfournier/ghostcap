Before taking you on how to make smooth stone in Minecraft, you should first know what smooth is and what it is used for.

Smooth stone is a different kind of stone in Minecraft, having a light color intensity, tending towards grey, and a clear outline.

There is no particular production recipe for making smooth stone, it is simply crafted by placing a stone on a furnace. For every stone block smelted, you get a block of smooth stone, a conversion rate of 1:1.

Smooth stone is made with stone, hence mining must precede the crafting for the stone to drop. A pickaxe is used for mining. Obtaining smooth stone also requires that you find houses and villages.

Stonecutters can also be applied on the smooth stone, just like all other blocks gotten from rocks.

Smooth stone has over time featured in Minecraft for a long time, but it has only recently become available to enthusiasts as a building block.

It can be applied in very small quantities in crafting recipes. A lot of players prefer to use it for decoration because of its smooth texture. Keep reading as you will be taken through a step-by-step guide on how to make smooth stones in Minecraft.

## A step-by-step guide to making smooth stone in Minecraft

Make a furnace for yourself (according to your needs)

Once you've gathered the resources, it's time to craft your smooth stone. To make a smooth stone, you must first make a kiln.

You can make a furnace from cobblestones and a crafting grid. You can as well make several furnaces at the same time.

You can speed up this process by creating a large number of furnaces. To do this, you will need a large number of cobblestones.

### Melt the cobblestones

Next, you will need to use the kiln to begin the smooth stone-making (smelting) process. Smelting is required to keep your stones smooth. To do this, a double smelting procedure must be carried out.

### Right-click on the furnace to open GUI

You can open the GUI by right-clicking on the furnace. You will come to a point where you can access your furnace menu.

### Add a fuel source in the lower groove of the furnace

You must fill the lower part of your furnace with fuel. As a fuel, charcoal, coal, or a bucket of lava, sticks, or other combustible objects can be used. You can also use anything made of wood for fuel in the kiln.

### Put the cobblestones in the furnace

Next, fill the upper door of your oven with a paving stone. As such, you are now enabled to make the smooth stone in the game.

### Allow the arrow to get completely filled

Wait a moment until the arrow fills in the furnace menu. This arrow shows the flow of the smelting process.

### Cobblestones have now turned into stones

After a while, you will get stones on the right slot of the furnace. Turning cobblestones into stones is the first step when smelting. These stones can be used to advance further in the game. Take the stones out of the furnace and this will reset the furnace in no time.

### Smelt the stone in the same furnace

Once you have smelted the cobblestones into stones, you can use these stones for further processing. You have to convert the stones into your desired products.

### Add another fuel source

Now add a fuel source to the same oven. Make sure you put the fuel (charcoal, coal, lava buckets, sticks, and anything combustible) at the bottom of your furnace. These aid in fuelling the furnace for smelting stones.

### Wait again until the arrow is completely filled

After pouring the fuel into the appropriate compartment, wait a while. You wait for the arrow to fill the furnace menu. The arrow filling up indicates that the stones are completely melted into smooth stones.

### Stones turning into smooth stones

You will see that the stones have been successfully converted to smooth stones. You can also see an arrow that is filled. This would be an indication that your smooth stone is now ready for use.

### Drag and drop smooth stones in your inventory

You can take the smooth stones out of the furnace. You can use your newly created smooth stones for various purposes in the Minecraft game. First, you need to drag and drop smooth stones into your Minecraft inventory.

You have succeeded in making smooth stones in the Minecraft game.

## Where to access the material needed to make the smooth stone

### The furnace

To get the furnace, you will need to make use of cobblestones. You need eight cobblestones per furnace. The furnace can also be gotten from trading villagers and other biomes.

### The cobblestone

Cobblestones can be gotten by mining with a pickaxe. All you need to do is to explore the Minecraft overworld and other biomes nearby. The pickaxe is compulsory for mining cobblestones and also to access any drop items.

### Fuel source

Any available fuel can be used in the furnace, however, it is imperative that you ensure you are using the right amount of fuel so that you can get the desired result.
