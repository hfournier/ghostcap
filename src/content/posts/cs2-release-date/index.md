The anticipation surrounding the release date of Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) has reached a fever pitch. As one of the most iconic first-person shooter (FPS) franchises, the excitement for this new game is palpable. Here's everything we know about the CS2 release date and what to expect from this highly anticipated sequel.

## Release Date and Limited Test

Valve has officially announced that [Counter-Strike 2](https://www.ghostcap.com/cs2-commands/) will release globally in the Summer of 2023. This release date window aligns with the information gathered from various sources, and fans eagerly await the arrival of this new shooter. The CS2 release date is further supported by the limited test beta that went live in March 2023, with access given to a select number of players to test various features of the game.

The Counter-Strike 2 limited-test beta was more restricted than anticipated, with only around 4% of CS:GO players currently having access to CS2 beta [according to Leetify](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/14fxbkj/the_cs2_access_rate_has_increased_by_33_since_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Many of these players are professionals or community figures. The limited-test beta version of CS2 currently includes maps like Anubis, Ancient, Dust 2, Mirage, and Nuke. Overpass was the first 'Upgrade' level map in the test, indicating that the release date is moving closer.

The best estimate, based on all available information, is that CS2 will release sometime in August. CS:GO itself was released on August 21, 2012, so it would be fitting for CS2 to release on the same date in 2023.

## New Features and Gameplay

Counter-Strike 2 is not just a mere update; it's a complete overhaul. Utilizing the new Source 2 engine, CS2 will feature dynamic smoke grenades that interact with the environment, improved graphics, and optimization. The maps of CS:GO have been completely rebuilt, and Source 2 tools and rendering features have been used to enhance the visual appeal.

One of the most significant changes in Counter-Strike 2 beta is the complete overhaul of the sub-tick update architecture. This means that moving and shooting will be equally responsive, regardless of the tick rate. All the items in the CS:GO inventory will be available in Counter-Strike 2, and they will look shinier due to the Source 2 lighting and materials.

## Esports and the Future

The first Counter-Strike Major that will be played on CS2, is to be held between March 17-31 in Copenhagen, 2024, [hosted by PGL](https://press.pglesports.com/235213-pgl-cs2-major-copenhagen-2024-the-first-ever-counter-strike-2-major-will-take-place-next-year-in-denmark).
