Not exactly a Pterodactyl theme, but Pterodactyl hosted for you. It comes with a nice sidebar theme by default, as well as some extra features that Pterodactyl doesn't have. I thought I would give it a mention here as it's what lots of people are looking for.

*   Easier to install than any theme

## Conclusion

Installing themes is pretty straight forward if you have a vanilla Pterodactyl panel, and most sellers have their own installation instructions or even install services. The only time it can really get messy is if you're using custom plugins or extensions.

Remember, if you have questions before installing your next theme, ask all the questions you need in their support Discords first.
