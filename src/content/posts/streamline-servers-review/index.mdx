Here is a quick rundown on why you would choose Streamline-Servers over other game server hosts

*   Best latency out of any game server hosting provider

**But why should you listen to us over other reviews?**

That's because, unlike the other Streamline-Servers Review articles you have read, we actually have first-hand **experience with them as a host.**

This is because over the past 20 years we have been gaming, and we have set up lots of game servers over that time.

Hosting game servers for people to have fun on is what we do, **it's our passion!**

We also know **multiple gaming communities** out there **that use Streamline Servers**.

One of the main issues when it comes to gaming hosts is overselling. This means when a server can only handle 10 game servers, they will actually sell 50 on that same machine.

We can tell you that this is not a practice Streamline-Servers does.

**You can be sure that the performance you're paying for, is the performance you're getting!**

But don't just take my word for it

The best way to see if a host is good is to simply try them out. [click here to view their plans](https://www.ghostcap.com/get/streamline-servers)!

I've had a few hiccups when it comes to their website. Sometimes the pages (such as their dashboard) were very slow and I would get error messages when trying to purchase something or even hosting my own server.

*   Outdated website

But other than that, there weren't any big complaints about them in general.

## Pricing

Streamline Servers have a good range of pricing and their prices are reasonable.

Their starting cost is about $2.50 per month for a game server on its own, but if you need something bigger you can get a dedicated server that starts at $150 per month.

Streamline Servers offer payments from:

*   Credit Card
*   Bitcoin

*   Poli
*   G2APAY

Their website also lists many different options available if you need more than the standard package, such as upgrades to your bandwidth and CPU power.
