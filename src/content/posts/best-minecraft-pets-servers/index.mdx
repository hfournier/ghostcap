We are considered a nation of pet lovers, and why shouldn’t Minecraft have a representation of what many believe has become a part of their families. Minecraft, with its countless mods, can feel like a lifeless, dry, and often boring place without our cute little fuzzy friends. That’s where Minecraft Pets comes in to fill the gaps, so to speak.

The Minecraft server mod is unique and quite interesting for many reasons, which we will not go into. However, suffice to say, if you want to try something a little different, why not log on to a couple of the Minecraft Pets servers in this article.

## Tulip Survival

Server IP: gg.tulipsurvival.com

TulipSurvival is an ultra-cool sever with many quality-of-life plugins that are meant to enhance your experience. You can use it to play with friends, create towns, claim land, and even find creative ways to exercise your pets.

The server also boasts grief protection, custom items, voting ranks, and a player economy. The community is a friendly place for pet lovers to meet up and discuss making their furry friends’ lives better.

## Wild Prison

Server IP: play.wildprison.net

Even though the main gameplay mechanics here have to do with prison, one of the coolest features of the server is the ability to raise pets. Here you can choose from a multitude of pets, train, and feed them the way you want. You can also participate in numerous competitive events with your pets and decide to reward them if you’re feeling lucky!

##   
The Seed

Server IP: msl.theseedmc.com

The Seed was created for players who mainly wanted a server with many coded features. While there are many custom features, the seed keeps things simple, and it is a community for those who enjoy playing with friends.

You can train your pets to do various things, including killing other animals. Perhaps that’s the most enjoyable part of this server. But there is lots of fun to be had with the dozens of other players on the server.

## Advancius Network

Server IP: mc.advancius.net

Now, if you are tired of all the play-to-win servers, mainly because it can get boring after 30 minutes, or are sick of all the unfriendly people, then Advancius Network is for you.

The server boasts of various game modes, and you have Pets. People who want to play Pets are greeted with numerous options, including matching their pets against others. You can also buy pets and train your pet to perform various stunts for lack of a better word. It is also possible to raise multiple pets.

The large number of players and a friendly community make the otherwise new server worth checking out.
