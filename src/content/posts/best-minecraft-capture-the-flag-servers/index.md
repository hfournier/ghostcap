Capture The Flag is one of the more popular Minecraft minigames, where the objective is for the player to capture the opposing team’s flag and take it back to their base to score points. Everything needs to be done within the 7-minute time limit. The first team with five captures or those with the highest score than other teams will win.

In the event there is a tie in the points, and the game ends once the timer expires, then it is taken to Sudden Death, where the very next capture will win the game for that team.

Also, there are no respawns. Though if one team kills every player of the opposing team, they will win. Players aren’t allowed to change kits or maybe use restock chests when playing Sudden Death.
