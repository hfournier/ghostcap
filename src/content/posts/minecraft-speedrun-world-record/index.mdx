Minecraft Speedrunning refers to the time a player takes to complete the Minecraft game. All over the world, players try to complete the game within a set time. Most times, it is a time they have set for themselves. Some players who have held the world records have played the game over and over again. And they have developed ways of winning the game.

When Minecraft players try to complete the games in less time, they usually spawn in, proceed to the nether and gravitate towards the end. Arriving at the end, they defeat the Ender Dragon in as little time as possible. The Minecraft game is interesting and with practice, it takes expert players less time to complete it. Players who have held world records usually take advantage of glitches to achieve their aims.  
There are different categories of the game available. The speedrunning records have categories including glitches with a random seed and glitches with a set seed. Holding the speedrunning world record is the result of continuous hard work. With constant speedrunning, players accomplish the game in less time. They get to know ways of reaching their goals in less time.

The speedrunning world record holder usually changes often because there is always someone else who beats the previous record holder. So far there have been several holders of the record. Here are five impressive world records of speedrunning on Minecraft.
