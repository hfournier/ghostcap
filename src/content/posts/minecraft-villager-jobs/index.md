The Minecraft world is filled with different villagers that function as humans. These villagers go to their various blocks and they have different items that they trade. However, it can be quite a hassle when you are trying to figure out how the villagers operate.

You have to figure out how they trade on the minefield and how to leverage upon the strengths of each villager. For you to achieve this on your own, you would have to go through failure and frustration from not being able to figure out the job of each villager.

If you need a particular profession, you can destroy their job site block and place the new one in their vicinity.

The Librarian is the best job for a villager. To create one, you need to place a lectern close to a jobless villager. This villager gives you access to the enchanted book after you trade with emeralds and an ordinary book. With this book, you can gain control over important tools used in the game.

Farming is the second-best job for villagers because they trade crops. There is nothing you would do on Minecraft that doesn’t require emeralds. This is the easiest way to get emeralds as you can use vegetables to create emeralds.
