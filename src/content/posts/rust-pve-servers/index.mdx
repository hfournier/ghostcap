If you have ever played [Rust](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/252490/) before, you know firsthand how unforgiving, sneaky, and rat-like the players can be (not to mention the toxic bs). You can't even get a good night's sleep without the thought of someone raiding you while you're offline.

However, what If I told you that you could play on a PVE Rust server and it's like playing a totally different game? Something that is fun, unique, and full of friendly players.

## Frequently Asked Questions about PVE Rust.

If you're looking to play PVE Rust, there may be some questions on your mind. Here are the most common questions other player have had about PVE servers.

*   ### What does PVE mean in Rust?
    
    <Image decoding="async" width="96" height="96" alt="Rust Music" sizes="(max-width: 96px) 100vw, 96px" src={__Rust_Music_150x150_png} widths={[150, 24, 48, 96, 300]} />
    
    In the game Rust, PVE stands for "Player vs Environment." This refers to gameplay that involves players working together to survive against computer-controlled enemies and challenges in the game world, rather than competing against or fighting other players (which is known as PVP, or "Player vs Player" gameplay).
    
*   ### Can you play Rust without PVP?
    
    <Image decoding="async" width="96" height="96" alt="Rust PVP" sizes="(max-width: 96px) 100vw, 96px" src={__Rust_PVP_150x150_png} widths={[150, 24, 48, 96, 300]} />
    
    Yes, it is possible to play Rust without engaging in a [Rust PVP server (Player vs Player)](https://www.ghostcap.com/rust-pvp-servers/) gameplay.
    
    On a PVE server, players work together to survive against computer-controlled enemies and challenges in the game world, such as wild animals, natural disasters, and other environmental threats.
    
*   ### How to make Rust server PVE?
    
    <Image decoding="async" width="96" height="96" alt="GhostCap 1v1 Rust Server" sizes="(max-width: 96px) 100vw, 96px" src={__GhostCap_1v1_Rust_Server_150x150_png} widths={[150, 24, 48, 96, 300]} />
    
    To set up a Rust PVE server, you need to start with a [vanilla Rust server](https://streamline-servers.com/billing/aff.php?aff=1093&pid=79). Once your server is running, you simply need to go to the server console and type "server.pve true" followed by "server.writecfg" to save the settings.
    
    However, for the best experience, I suggest you use [Oxide](https://umod.org/games/rust) for installing plugins and use the plugin [True PVE by nivex](https://umod.org/plugins/true-pve).
