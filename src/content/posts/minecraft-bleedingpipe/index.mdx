As the world of gaming evolves, so too do the threats that lurk within it. One such threat that has recently come to light is the 'BleedingPipe' vulnerability in Minecraft, a popular sandbox video game. This security hole has raised alarms in the gaming community due to its potential to allow hackers to execute remote code on players' computers. In this blog post, we will delve into the details of this vulnerability, its implications, and how players can protect themselves.

## The Discovery of BleedingPipe

The BleedingPipe vulnerability was first identified by a user group known as the [Minecraft Malware Prevention Alliance (MMPA)](https://blog.mmpa.info/posts/bleeding-pipe/). This security hole exploits Java deserialization to infect servers or clients that have certain popular mods installed. The vulnerability is particularly concerning because it can affect not only Minecraft servers but also players' home computers.

The number of Minecraft mods vulnerable to BleedingPipe is extensive. A German Computer Science student, known as [Dogboy21 on GitHub](https://github.com/dogboy21), has identified three dozen popular mods that carry this vulnerability. These range from AetherCraft to Immersive Armors to ttCore.

## How BleedingPipe Works

BleedingPipe operates by exploiting a problem with the ObjectInputStream class in Java. A hacker can feed data to the server with code that carries out malicious actions. When the server receives this code and deserializes it (i.e., changes it from binary into an object), the malicious code gets executed on the server side. If the server itself is infected, it could feed binary data back to a client (a player), whose PC deserializes it locally and executes the code.

The implications of this vulnerability are far-reaching. If a hacker is able to execute code on either the server or client side, they could potentially exfiltrate user data for identity theft or take over a computer for botnet attacks on other systems.

## The Real-World Impact of BleedingPipe

In July, a player known as [Yoyoyopo5](https://www.twitch.tv/yoyoyopo5) was running a public server using Forge 14.23.5.2860 mods. During a live stream, a malicious user exploited BleedingPipe to gain control and execute code on every connected player's device. The hacker used the remote code to steal browser, Discord, and Steam session info.

## Protecting Yourself from BleedingPipe

To protect yourself from this vulnerability, the MMPA recommends checking for infected files in your .minecraft directory using a scanner such as [nekodetector](https://github.com/MCRcortex/nekodetector) or [jNeedle](https://github.com/KosmX/jneedle). If you're using any of the vulnerable mods, Dogboy21 recommends downloading his patch.

For those who run servers, MMPA suggests running JSus or jNeedle on all of your installed mods. It also recommends updating to the latest versions of EnderIO or LogisticsPipes if you're using those. The group has created its own security mod called PipeBlocker, which is designed to block these attacks.

## Conclusion

The discovery of the BleedingPipe vulnerability serves as a stark reminder of the importance of cybersecurity in the gaming world. As players, it's crucial to stay informed about these threats and take the necessary steps to protect ourselves. As we continue to enjoy the immersive worlds that games like Minecraft offer, let's also remember to prioritize our digital safety.
