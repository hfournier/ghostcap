Nongamers may probably be okay with moving their mouse around on the desk, but gamers understand the importance of a genuinely efficient gaming desk pad.

Sure, a desk pad or a mouse pad as it is called may not be considered a gaming essential, but it is something nice to have.

At any rate, it will provide you with the best performance when paired with a quality gaming mouse.

If you have a frayed mess, you call a mouse mat or a desk pad, now would be the best time to switch up to something a lot nicer. In fact, we've got a pretty stacked selection of the best gaming desk pads in our experience.

The no. 1 desk pad ticks all the boxes, and that's why we'll start with that one. We will then work our way down to pads that are less than what we consider ideal but still up there with the best of the best.

## Aim Monster Geisha Skull Gaming Desk Mat

First on our list for the best gaming desk pads is Aim Monster.

But I have to get this out the way. We ARE affiliated with Aim Monster. We are not some massive company, we are gamers just like you!

Available in 31" × 15.5", 12" × 18", and 12" × 22", the customized [gaming desk pad](https://www.etsy.com/shop/AimMonster) designs are guaranteed to set your gaming space apart from all the rest. The mats are coated with a neoprene material, which provides the right amount of comfort to accommodate hours of gaming while still being durable.

The 4mm thick layer, coupled with the low friction surface, is ideal for gamers who play [competitive shooters like Counter-Strike](https://www.ghostcap.com/cs-go-competitive-servers/) that require quick reflexes.

The other major advantage of the Geisha Skull is the fact that they are water-resistant. So, you don't need to worry about damaging the padding underneath. All you need to do is wipe it down with a wet rag if you spill coffee or water over it. They also feature stitched edges to ensure the low friction surface wont fray.

Finally, there is another reason why the Geisha Skull is our #1 pick, i.e., its highly competitive pricing, which offers the best value to money, in our opinion.

## Razer Strider

  widths={[1920, 768, 1536]}
/>

The Razer Strider's claim to fame is its hybrid approach, with a flex yet soft finish mouse pad, which sticks to the desk. The firm fabric lines on Razer's desk pad can deliver an effortless and fast glide, which can be paired with any mouse. However, you'll see significant gains when paired with a high DPI gaming mouse.

The Strider is a comfortable, well-rounded mouse pad that hugs the desk, offering an excellent gaming experience, but one which will cost you a premium.

## Corsair MM300 Extended

<Image

  sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px"
  src={__CORSAIR_MM300_PRO_Gaming_Mouse_Pad_2160x1439_jpg}
  widths={[2160, 768, 1536, 2048, 1920]}
/>

The MM300 is Corsair's premium desk pad, with a non-slip rubber base, a sturdy 0.12 inches of thickness, and stitched edges that will prevent fraying. If you want the most oversized possible desk pad, go for the 'Extended' version, which accommodates a gaming keyboard, and still has lots of room.

The smooth textile weave makes gliding any mouse across the surface quick and easy. It is also easier to pinpoint attacks in FPS games so as long as you have a beefy high DPI mouse.

While Corsairs gaming mouse pads are a reasonable size, they are not really tall enough for low-sensitivity gaming. This desk pad would be more suitable for high DPI mice.

## Novelkeys Deskpad

  widths={[2160, 768, 1536, 2048, 1920]}
/>

The Novelkeys brand is a pretty well-known one, perhaps best known for its custom group buys, which cover everything that an enthusiast could desire. As it turns out, they also specialize in manufacturing, designing, and selling mega desk pads.

It's a durably built desk pad with anti fray stitching that has the potential of lasting for years. The only thing we don't like is the generic designs.

## Logitech G440

The G440 offers gamers a solid surface, which spells pure speed and very low tactile resistance. The low friction surface feels great, and moving our mouse across it felt like it was gliding on water. Our problem was that the G440 was way too smooth. It means that you're not just moving the mouse but also stopping it, which takes a little getting used to. Our other concern is that the polyethylene surface with microtextures will probably wear out after a while; when exactly that happens, only time will tell.

## Corsair MM800 Polaris RGB

What good is a gaming desk pad if it does not have RGB? Corsair's solution is a lot more than just flashy lights. The MM800 Polaris comes with RGB. It features an excellent micro-texture surface, allowing you to glide across it without sacrificing precision effortlessly.

It is a durably built RGB mousepad, which we suspect will not play well with water or any other liquid on it. What we do like about the MM800is the pass-through USB port, which allows you to plug in your flash drive or mouses directly. Then there are the 15 LEDs, which are far brighter than what you'll get with Razer's Firefly HyperFlux.

The software allows users to create advanced lighting profiles for the desk pad. The profiles can also be shared with other users. While not a "desk pad", we felt the need to list this due to being a hard mouse pad. That is something you generally don't get these days with a good mouse pad.

## Razer Gigantus V2

You can buy the Gigantus V2 in several sizes starting from the small 14-inch version to the large 47-inch version. If anything, the largest size will cover most gaming desks. The mousepads can be customized with your favorite characters, logo, or anything else.

The soft surface performs exceptionally well, but if you are used to rugged surface mats, this will take some getting used to.

## SteelSeries QcK Gaming Surface

  }
  widths={[1200, 768]}
/>

Image via: [SteelSeries](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mousepads/qck-series)

It is the best-selling gaming mouse mat of all time, at least in terms of sales. However, there is a reason why it has done so well, which includes the large 35 x 16-inch real estate, a thick 4mm rubber base, and a sturdy design.

SteelSeries uses a proprietary fabric QcK's, which tracks well at the highest DPI setting, and honestly feels very good under the hands.

The problem with this mouse pad is that there is nothing special about it. It does not add any character to your desk but instead is angled towards gamers who want something more conservative, maybe!

## Castle Courtyard Leather Desk Pad

<Image

  sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"
  src={__Castle_Courtyard_Leather_Desk_Pad_jpg}
  widths={[1500, 768]}
/>

It is a brand new product by Castle, which is available in two options, the first is with a logo, and then there is one with no logo. The one without the logo offers an excellent minimalistic design, not screaming "gamer". Perfect if you don't like RGB lighting or the design of normal gaming hardware.

Castile's marketing is quirky, but their products are solid, and the Courtyard is certainly one of them. Unlike other pads on this list, this will not have the tracking ability dedicated gamer mats will have.

## Gallaway Leather Desk Pad

![](Gallaway-Leather-Desk-Pad.jpg)

Like gaming chairs, the Gallaway Leather Desk Pad uses PU leather. It offers a rugged yet traditional design that ups the ante on large desk pads. The pad feels comfortable under the hand, as you might imagine, but it isn't as solidly built as some of the other desk pads we've listed above.

## What Is Wrong With Normal Mouse Pads?

The average mouse pad is fine for general use, but it's not ideal for gaming. The surface is too rough, which means your mouse won't move as easily. This can cause you to lose track of your cursor or make it difficult to make precise movements.

A gaming mouse pad has a smoother surface that helps your mouse move more easily. It also has a built-in cushion that provides extra comfort and support. This can help you stay focused during long gaming sessions.

Another important feature of a gaming mouse pad is its size. A standard mouse pad is too small for gaming, but a gaming mouse pad is large enough to accommodate your entire hand. This allows you to move your mouse around more easily and gives you more control over your cursor.

If you're serious about gaming, then you need a gaming mouse pad. It provides the extra precision and comfort that you need to succeed. So ditch the standard mouse pad and invest in a gaming mouse pad today. You won't regret it!
