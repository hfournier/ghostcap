*   ease of taming and availability. Some of them, such as the Moschops and Ichthyornis, might seem unconventional, but they are relatively easy to tame once you have a decent setup.
*   This guide focuses on the Island, Scorched Earth, and Aberration maps, as players often find it challenging to locate and tame suitable creatures for kibble farming on these maps. However, if the creatures listed here also spawn on other maps, you can use this guide for those maps as well.
*   As new maps are released, we will update this guide accordingly. We also plan to add more map-specific guides in the future to cover all available maps in Ark: Survival Evolved.
*   When setting up your kibble farm, it's crucial to ensure that you have adequate space and resources to accommodate and maintain the creatures you've chosen for farming. Consider building a secure and well-organized pen or enclosure to house your creatures and protect them from potential threats.
*   Be mindful of the temperature and environmental requirements of your creatures. Some creatures may need specific conditions to lay eggs or thrive, so make sure you meet these requirements to maximize your kibble production.
*   Always keep an eye on your creatures' food and health, as a well-fed and healthy creature will produce more eggs. Make sure to provide them with enough food and water, and use feeding troughs to help automate the feeding process.
*   Consider using Oviraptors to increase egg production in your farm. Oviraptors, when set to wander and correctly weighed down, provide a passive buff that boosts egg-laying rates for nearby creatures.
*   Finally, be patient and persistent when building and managing your kibble farm. It may take some time and effort to establish a successful and efficient farm, but the rewards are well worth it in the long run.

With this comprehensive guide, you'll be well on your way to creating a thriving kibble farm in Ark: Survival Evolved. As you continue to explore new maps and tame different creatures, remember to adapt your strategies and stay informed on the latest tips and tricks for kibble farming. Good luck, and happy farming!
